AskReddit,c36g82s,"Mine kind of pales in comparison to many of these other stories, but it took place in 6th grade (it was a rough year): 
I had 2-3 really close friends from elementary school. I was so happy when we had the same teacher in middle school and I was extremely excited for the trip we had later in the year where we got put in groups with a few people (that we request) and do stuff for 5 days. 
 So, that time rolled around. My friends had become ""popular"", and I struggled to keep up with them. They could all afford $50 shirts and $100 jeans (6th grade, mind you. We were still growing). I was stuck in my JCPenney and Kohl's clothes. I liked them, but being a young girl struggling to fit in, I felt awkward. Anyway, ""we"" befriended this one girl who obviously had enough money to buy a lot of cool clothes. She was athletic, funny, ""cool"", etc. A lot better than I saw myself. Let's call her ""Emily"". She, my 2 friends (let's call them ""Maddy"" and ""Cass""), and another girl and I were all in a group. The first 2 days were fine and dandy, but the 3rd day fucking sucked. 
 Let's get something straight here: I am  not  coordinated. I do track because I can't kick balls, throw balls, or hit balls with bats. Anyway, on the 3rd day, we were doing separate activities for ""free time"" with our friends. My 2 close elementary friends and I were kicking a soccer ball around. I usually missed it or kicked too hard or whatever. I felt really bad and embarrassed. So then comes Emily. She poked fun at me, I didn't mind. I thought we were friends. Eventually, she, Maddy, and Cass stopped kicking to me and just made fun of me. Sensitive young me felt left out and sat at a park bench and cried. 
 Thankfully, my current best friends were the ones that consoled me. But the 3 bitches didn't stop there. Once we got back to our town, they started bullying me through AIM, at school, and everything. I spent every day crying. They turned a bunch of people (people I hadn't ever talked to) against me and I was teased a  lot . I was teased for my clothes, my hair, my intelligence (I focused on school more than them), and my family. I was called an ""it"", an ugly whore that would never have any friends/boyfriends, a mistake, etc. Those skanks ruined middle school for me. They are part of the reason I have low self-esteem 5 years later. They were brutal.","Close friends from elementary school teamed up with a rich, trendy, cool girl and teased me hard enough to leave an impact 5+ years later."
AskReddit,ca738at,"living is france, it's more that French society values societal politeness and the ""general good"", which means you're going to be  told  if you're out of place. You're brought up in a society, not simply a family unit. Education comes from all. 
 This upfront, honest confrontation makes many anglo-saxons uncomfortable. Understandably, as confrontation equates aggression for us (I'm a US-france exchange student), but taking our cultural norms and assuming other people in other societies follow such leads to miscommunication, and misunderstanding. Then we find ourselves with stereotypes which have a drop of truth, but a bucket of ignorance. 
 Most, if not all french people I know, are warmer then a morning baguette from the baker. They just have a crunch exterior which we anglo-saxons are habituated to a more homogenous texture seeing in supermarket loaf bread ;]","you are what you[r society values, and because of that,] eat!"
AskReddit,c5s6xe3,"One night out at college we went for some late night snacks at a local chinese takeout place. While there, I thought it would be a fantastic idea to try and pickup the cashier as she went to get our food and finished making it. I thought I had made some serious ground on the matter, and as I was leaving I took a nearby sharpie and signed their buddha statue and left my number. To this day the signature and number are still there, and every so often some random person will call me or send me a text.","failed to pickup a chinese cashier, signed a buddha statue instead."
AskReddit,c6bop7m,"I was probably 12 or 13 years old and went to Six Flags Marine World. I walked by one of those ""Win a Free Car"" displays where you fill out your info on a little sheet and toss it in a box. Fast forward a month or two and I get a call informing me I had moved onto the next stage in the contest. I actually never thought anyone won those contests. Another few weeks go by and I get another call saying I advanced to the semi-final round and won a full trip for 2 to Vegas. At this point the guy wanted to verify my info and basically I was disqualified from the contest because you had to be 18. Another couple weeks go by and I get another call, apparently the guy didn't remove my name because I won the Grand Prize, winning the car. They wouldn't let me transfer the prize to my parents or anything, it was pretty weak to say the least. I feel like you only get once chance in a lifetime to win crap like this and I used up my chance when I couldn't even win.

AskReddit,cd6c0z2,"Oh man. I have short hair now, but for years I had hair past my waist and since ain't nobody got time for that (tm) it spent most of high school in a messy bun-thing that was about the size of a large grapefruit. 
 People would ask me how long it took me to do my hair. ""Seconds, why?"" ""Well, what do you use?"" ""A hair tie."" ""Just one?"" ""Yeah."" ""How?""

 As an added bonus, if I wanted to take it down I just had to pull one spot on the hair tie and it all came tumbling down. Handy!",for 4 years of my life I have no idea how I styled my hair.
AskReddit,cl6e4fg,"I went to high school with this guy. We weren't super close, but he did hang out with my group of friends a few times back in the day. He was childhood friends with a couple of the guys in our group. Most of us thought he was a little weird, but mostly harmless. 
 He ended up becoming a sheriff in our hometown after high school. A year or two ago, we found out he had gotten arrested for running a child porn operation. I don't know if it was a website or what, but they found literally thousands of pics and media on his personal computer. He was engaged at the time, but luckily didn't have any kids yet. Really weird to find that out.",Went to high school with a cop who ran some sort of child porn ring.
AskReddit,cb3m9wb,"I feel like the girl I love doesn't want me. 
 She seems to keep me separate from the rest of her life and keeps me around just she'll have someone to be there if she needs. We've been dating for a while yet she doesn't like it when I hang out with her friends  especially  when shes there. In fact, she recently split her social calendar to ""one day for my friends, one day for you"". A part of me feels like I interrupted a budding relation ship between her and one of her guy friends. 
 I try to do my best to make her happy; I've made her family happier, helped her with everything I could, and even opened up potential careers through the people I've introduced her to. 
 Yet, despite my best efforts, I still feel like I'm treated like an unnecessary luxury. Nice to have around, but if I wasn't, nothing much would change.

AskReddit,c5mdvqb,"So look, in 6th grade, I started jackin' it. We just had sex ed (Catholic sex ed), and I was like ""okay, that sounds kinda fun besides the don't do it, it's evil part"". They say that it takes 10,000 hours to become a virtuoso at an instrument, so needless to say I was pretty much the Victor Wooten of beating off by 7th grade. 
 At this time, generally speaking, there was pussy on the brain for all of the junior high boys. One of our friends had a screaming fast 28.8kbps connection to AOL and was looking at tits. We all gathered round and started giggling (literally) at this busty new world of boobage splayed before us. Jokes were had, merriment was made, and I said something along the lines of ""hah, I'll be saving this for later.""

 (Tumbleweed rolls) Oh... shit.. 
 The next day at school, I was a fucking leper. A jizzy, lanky, half-pubescent leper. The eyes, the eyes! Reddit...I'll never forget them. 
 The girls looked at me distrustfully, like I was this lawn sprinkler of cum spurting in a haphazard 270 degree arc on a lawn of dead flowers. The boys were not amused, how dare I touch my own penis, that's gay. My gossip-ass-snitches-get-stitches-bitch-friends told EVERYONE. 
 So on it went, fucking D.K. barrel'd down the grade school social ladder. I honestly wanted to transfer schools. There was no possible way I could live this down. I was The Masturbator™. That was me. 
 Then, 8th grade happens. I show up first day of school expecting another year of revulsion, but suddenly my friends are downright chummy. Cool! Maybe everyone forgot over the summer! Ugh but the girls, those accusatory glares.....are conspicuously...absent. I'm going to dances. I'm holding hands. Why is everyone so suddenly.....nice? 
 OH HELL NO! YOU ALL FUCKING TOOK YOUR JUNK OUT FOR A TEST DRIVE AND DECIDED YOU LIKED HOW IT HANDLED. I was the goddamn test pilot and I crashed and burned, but you fucking lemmings decided that I had a thing going on that demanded further investigation.","Fuck you junior high, I was masturbating before it was cool."
AskReddit,chjg3x8,"So I was fishing at a reservoir near my house.  In order to get to the spot on the bank that I was fishing you have to park then walk through about 150 yards of woods.  It is my lazy fishing spot when I don't want to take my boat out.  So I go one afternoon after work about an hour or so before dark.  I had a decent day fishing, a few Blue Gill and a catfish or two.  I rarely keep fish but I really love catfish so I kept them and I kept the Blue Gill for my neighbor who grinds them into ""fishcakes"". 
     So it is starting to get dark and I decide to leave.  It is still semi-light out near the bank of the reservoir because there is no tree cover.  I gather all my poles, fish and gear together and start walking back through the woods to my car.  About 50 yards in I hear a rustle in the woods and see a flash out of the corner of my eye.  I don't know what it was but my mind decided it was either ""The Devil"" or a Bear.  So my mind tells my body to run full speed with reckless abandon.  I dropped my fish and kept running.... but it is dark in the woods so I fall break my fishing pole and drop my gear box.  I get up limping and covered in dirt and leaves and continue my full on sprint to the car. My heart is racing, I am covered in dirt and leaves and then i see it.  A bunch of HS kids were walking to the bank to go swimming.  Probably a group of 8-10 kids with beers.  So I realize that I was not being chased by the devil or a bear and go back to retrieve my fish, poles & gear.  Standing there by where I was originally spooked were two HS girls in towels.... laughing.  I pick up all my shit and walk back to my car feeling like a fool.","I thought I was being chased by The Devil or a Bear in the woods, it was really a bunch of HS kids going to drink and party & they saw me get spooked run and fall & laughed at me."
AskReddit,cjzinvv,"Warning: very long 
 When I was studying abroad in Japan I happened to meet someone with a similar bracelet as me at a bar my first night there. The bracelet was given to both of us as a sign of a completion of a trip from a YMCA camp here in Minnesota. I went there as a camper and later ended up working there and this guy (Henry) was a camper there as well. We both told one another that one of our goals while in Japan was to climb to the summit of Mt. Fuji and watch the sunrise there as Japan translates to the ""land of the rising sun"" and Mt. Fuji is the tallest point of Japan. 
 We kept being busy with other activities during our time there that we could not properly coordinate the climb in August, September, or October. As November was drawing to a close, we realized that Henry was leaving the following month and that we could no longer put off the climb. We decided to climb it the last weekend of November. 
 Now it is important to realize that the official climbing season for Mt. Fuji is June-August because that is when the weather allows for safest climbing. The other nine months of the year everything on the mountain is closed and the trails are no longer maintained until the following season. Henry and I felt confident in our abilities because of the camp that we went to and as such took a week to gather supplies and equipment. 
 We arrived by the mountain early in the morning and hiked through the forest before reaching the base of the mountain. From there we had hours to kill before we were to start the night hike at 10:00 PM. We rested, ate up, and kept warm however we could but it was only 40 degrees Fahrenheit. It was finally nightfall and we were anxious to start our adventure. There were few hikers on the mountain with us but we knew of our abilities and proceeded forward even with people warning us against it. 
 During the first hour of the climb we start noticing a sharp drop in the temperature as we lose cover from the trees and get higher in elevation. We check the temperature and see that it had dropped to about 10 degrees Fahrenheit. We were not expecting temperatures that low and were not adequately prepared for such low conditions. As a measure to maintain warmth we started to climb faster and using our body heat to push us through the frigid temperatures. 
 We are both confident and experienced hikers so our pace was faster than what we had read would take to reach the summit. Because of this we arrive about an hour and half early than anticipated to the summit. This meant that the thing that had kept us warm was no longer available. At first we thought that we would be fine at the top but the sweat that we had generated on the climb up was starting to freeze to our bodies. We knew that we would have to do something else to keep warm so we devised a strategy to avoid hypothermia. 
 We decided to get into our sleeping bags, which were rated for these cold temperatures and take a nap until shortly before the sunrise to warm up. As we are digging through our bags we notice that we only packed one. The person who forgot theirs shall remain nameless (it was me) but fortunately the other person was kind enough to share. So we now had to decide who was going to go where and we decided that the fairest method for choosing would be a game of rock paper scissors. 
 After the grueling match I ended up being little spoon and Henry and I spooned for warmth on top of the mountain. We survived with neither hypothermia nor frostbite and we got to see the most beautiful sunrise I have ever had the chance to witness. We stayed up there hours after the sunrise just in awe of what we had done. We both left the mountain with a sense of accomplishment and a great life memory.",I spooned a man to avoid hypothermia on the summit of a volcano.
AskReddit,cm9q6bv,"The last bar I worked security at, we'd get out around 2:30 in the morning, with new usually being the last out. This one night I lock up, walk a bartender to get car, then walk to my car, only to then realize I forgot my phone charger in the office, so I walk back to get it. 
 By this time it's like 3am, the street is empty, even the latent drunks and bums have wandered off, and I go back in the bar and walk back to the office using my flashlight because the light switches are at the back. Anyway, I grab my charger, start to head back to the front, and then I hear it.

 Sophomore year of college, me and my 7 buddies moved into a house together. This was our first time living away from our parents or any other responsible adult (we were in the dorms the year before), so needless to say shit got crazy, early and often. 
 One weekend, my roommates friend from high school was in town visiting. This guy was as dumb as a door knob, though somehow had quite a bit of game. I guess he was too stupid to know when to not talk to women, and when he did talk to them, managed to get out at least a few flattering words. 
 Anyway, true to his nature, he begins talking to this girl while we're having a small party at our house. She was pretty smoking, wearing pretty skimpy clothes (like a mini-skirt that barely covers her ass - this becomes important later). They're hitting it off, she's laughing and giggling and all that, and then they start sucking face on the couch in our living room. Things start to get hot an heavy, but they had no where to take it as this wasn't his house, and he was planning on crashing on the couch that night. 
 Later, he comes up to me and asks if he can ""borrow my room"" for a little bit. Me, being drunk, and wanting to help him out if possible, hand him my keys and tell him ""keep it on the couch, and stay, THE FUCK, off of my bed."" He agrees, but I make him promise. They go up, yadda yadda, come back down about 20 minutes later, he hands me the keys, and says ""thanks"" with an enormous shit eating grin on his face. 
 Fast-forward about 2 hours. The night is winding down, so I head up into my room to go to sleep. I hadn't been in my room since it had been previously occupied, so I decide to do a quick damage inspection. I open my room, and notice that the couch looks surprisingly... unused. All the pillows are in place, and nothing was moved off of it. My BED, however, is in shambles. The covers are all messed up, pillows pushed around, and... a dark red spot, about the size of a silver dollar, on my sheets. Having no idea what it is, I ask my girlfriend what it is, who bursts out laughing, hardly able to control herself. She then informs me that it is, without a doubt, period blood (remember how I said the mini-skirt was important?). 
 Turns out, he tried to have sex with her, but she couldn't because it was that time of the month. She gave him a BJ instead, but not before depositing some of her ""flow"" on my bed.

AskReddit,c82t3wg,"Ok, this happened to me Junior year. I was in a church group that would go on retreats to this little camp ground. Had a few buildings and a couple buildings for lodging. It was a great time, had a bunch of friends there and the church was kept to a minimal, until night came on Saturday. 
 We had spent the entire day doing pretty active stuff. Went canoeing, played football, etc. We were gathered in a big meeting room where I assumed we would have a quick meeting then go to bed. The meeting started taking longer then excpected (like 45 minutes) and finally the camp leader said something along the lines of ""we're going to try something that may seem weird to some of you."" 
 Now I wasn't put off at all, not much bugs me or bothers me. We all got in a circle and they started calling out to the ""holy spirit"" to move someone to come forward. Someone does, he does a little prayer, they ""faint"". Again, a little on edge but not too worried. What really got to me though was a friend I had, we had been friends for a while, started speaking in tongues. Straight up super fast rambling in a language I didn't recognize. I catch eyes with another guy I kind of knew and we both had this ""let's get the fuck out of here"" look. So we leave and head to our room, all the time more people are fainting and my friend was continuing to speak in tongues.

AskReddit,c8x53vs,"The article [Brainology]( gives some pretty good insight as to how children should be taught. It describes the differences betwen a growth mindset and a fixed mindset: 
 
 A fixed mindset believes that their intelligence is fixed and innate; when they make mistakes, they believe that it is their fault and they can't do anything about it because they were born that way. As a result, they are discouraged and aren't willing to challenge themselves. It's enforced by praising kids for their intelligence, not their hard work. 
 
 A growth mindset believes that ""intelligence is something that be cultivated through effort and education. They know that in order to become successful and smart, they'll have to do some hard work. It's enforcced by praising kids for their hard work (as opposed to their intelligence).","Whenever children do something good, praise them for their hard work, not their intelligence. 
 For example, when they do good on a test, say ""wow, I bet studied hard to get this good grade!"" instead of ""wow, you must have gotten a good grade because you're so smart!""

 You could probably get  worse  at it, but the brain has its own form of parity-checking on half-forgotten techniques, skills and memories that would quickly repair the blanks. Think about how you can't recall things until provided certain clues, at which point other memories become accessible too. Or how you can't quite forget how to ride a bicycle, even if you start out rusty at first. 
 When your neurons make associations, it also affects other associations made by the same neuron.

AskReddit,c5mjywl,"I've been on both sides of the fence with cheating.  It's wrong; it cheapens your experience and discredits your degree. 
 My first semester in college I used an answer key to help with my multivariable calculus homework.  At first I just used it to check over my answers and make sure that they made sense.  However, I was soon relying on it as a crutch to complete my assignments the night before they were do.  By the end of the semester I was barely even attempting the problems before writing down what the key said.  Consequently, I was not well prepared for the tests, and ended up failing the class.  I retook the class later, without using the answer key, and did much better. 
 I've also had the unfortunate obligation to turn in a peer for cheating.  We were given a take-home exam in a 400-level math class, and I had the misfortune to bump into one of the most loved and respected undergraduates being fed the solutions by a mutual friend.  I had no choice but to turn them in (I think the professor was very lenient and let them take a 0 on the exam).  That student and I never spoke to each other again, although we had previously been fairly close. 
 Perhaps I'm hypocritical because of this?  I'm not sure.  In both cases the result was the same: we both failed the respective classes and had to retake them again later.

AskReddit,cbdhs84,"My parents have always been Christians, but not fundamentalist or orthodox like people seem to think every Christian is. My dad loves science and studies physics in his spare time for instance. 
 When I was going to school there was very few people who were religious, or at least very few people who let people know they were religious. I was growing up learning to think rationally and logically, and to put empirical evidence first. 
 At the same time, my parents often made me go to their ""church"", if you could call it that (Was more like a meeting place with different people having presentations and a lot of singing). Through this I was introduced to people of faith my age, and a lot of summer camps. (This was around middle school). 
 It was really fun being at camp and talking to those people and I had a great time, but at the same time, I just could not relate to any of the Christian parts of the camps. I listened to the meetings, and sang the songs, but I never felt any connection to God, and I just felt awkward raising my hands in the sky to praise him, but I did it cause everyone else did. 
 This conflict kept going most of my teenage years. I branded myself as a Christian, but when I look back, deep down I didn't really believe any of it, and I found the materialistic world view much more sensible, but I never really debated anyone, when I talked to atheists I agreed, and I also agreed when I talked to Christians. 
 Then when I was 18 and I just broke up with my first long term relationship (1 year and 4 months), I had an existential breakdown and got major anxiety towards the reality of existence, and the fact that we are all mortal. When this happened I became much more serious in how I feel I view the world. I needed to find a solution that i connect with, and I became searching more thoroughly. 
 after high school (I'm from Norway so school details may be off for some people), I joined a type of community college which lasts a year. The majority of these schools are Christian in nature, but a lot of non-religious people tend to go there as well. I chose the music ""major"" and just had fun connecting with people and playing music. This year kind of put all of my worries at a stop. I stopped thinking about life and just had fun for a year. So when the year was over, it all came flooding back. 
 I'm not gonna lie, I was trying to find something to convince me that God was real, since I was so scared of this reality being the only thing that exists, and it will be over before you know it. Then one day I start to see these presentations of these ""controversial"" scientists, who are presenting very sound evidence that the materialistic dogmas are really just assumptions with no good evidence supporting it. 
 I researched this more, and began to find lots of very smart, intellectual people who have turned their heads to religion without any doubt, and spent many hours listening to these podcasts, debates and presentations. They were presenting good, scientific arguments FOR the existence of God, which was really surprising to me. All of this made so much sense, and I began developing a more stable, sound faith in God. 
 I'm 20 now and I'm still conflicted, but I have a much better understanding of the whole debate. I listen to a lot of apologetics and a lot of atheists, but the majority of debates is going on in my head. There are things that are conflicting my belief in God, but there are a lot of things that are supporting it as well. All in all, if someone were to ask me now, I would say in good confidence I am a Christian. 
 If you want to know more about these scientists I was talking about, you can look up people like William Lane Craig, John Lennox, Rupert Sheldrake, Jeffrey Long, Raymond Moody and Mario Beauregard. 
 The most important problem I see people have with these people, is that they aren't listening with an open mind. They have their own belief before they listen, and they refuse to think anything they are saying is logical, because it's conflicting their own beliefs. This is why I hate debating with atheists, because they are more narrow-minded than the religious people they are trying to put down. 
 I hope someone reads this even though I'm quite late to the discussion! 
 Edit:","Christian parents, raised in two different environments, christian and atheist. grew up conflicted. Started taking reality seriously and started researching more. Found good logic and reason to have faith."
AskReddit,c1135o3,"this might be kind of off-point but might add some clarification.  (or might add confusion, i don't know!)  i'm asian, japanese in fact, just to clear that up. 
 i noticed a specific change within myself during my adult years, perhaps after years of reading various histories about wwii.  i'm a friendly person by nature &, while out walking the dogs or whatnot, greet whomever i come across.  when i moved into a neighborhood with a high first-generation chinese population (i.e., higher than anywhere i had lived previously), i'd find myself feeling embarrassed by & accountable for my forebears' conduct in other pacific countries.  i'd still greet them as i would anyone, but there was a certain reluctance of the chinese (mainly 1st-generation, as chinese-americans seem to be as 'american' as i am) to make eye contact, & i felt it was incumbent upon me to allow & forgive that it just might be due to my ethnicity.  (the reality is that that this was probably not from hatred of japanese but more likely general behavior for protection/privacy, as i imagine many asian cultures share this attribute.) 
 while i wasn't alive during the times of japan's worst offenses against their neighbors, i'm sensitive to the fact that other asians (even those who might not have been subjected to said offenses personally) may not necessarily feel the same way, whether or not they acknowledge it within themselves. 
 i met a gentleman once (white american) who had fought in the phillippines in wwii.  he told me very honestly that he hated everything about the japanese for many, many years.  i'm sure that i can't even begin to imagine the horrors he witnessed & experienced, so i completely understood (& truly appreciated his candor).  i doubt anyone who hasn't directly experienced war can comprehend its impact, no matter how many books one reads.

AskReddit,ciwaw5s,"The student strike situation we had in Québec a few years ago caused a lot of Baby Boomers to act in a ""retroactively entitled"" fashion, if I can put it that way. 
 Essentially, back when the Baby Boomers were in their late teens/early twenties, the province of Québec was in the midst of important social changes that saw the province become more of a true social democracy. Part of that was the reform of healthcare and education systems. Public colleges (Cégeps) were created and higher education became more accessible. 
 Short story, the young Baby Boomers got everything a young generation might want: public programs that mainly benefit the young and less wealthy (like students) paid for by taxes (thus mainly paid by their parents' generation.) 
 A few years ago, the government said it was going to have to increase tuition fees significantly. Tuition had been so cheap for so long that everyone sort of took it for granted that tuition here was cheap. But since this was now threatened, a lot of students were willing to take to the streets to fight for what they thought was an important part of our society. They wanted to make sure higher education would be as easy to access for them and their children than it was for previous generations. 
 A lot of people from the generation in power (the Baby Boomers) were sympathetic, but some viewed the student strikes as one more example of ""young people being entitled, wanting everything handed to them."" However, when you think about it, all that the students wanted was to keep the same right to education that the Baby Boomers had. They weren't fighting to get more, they were fighting to keep the rights that students have had for a few generations now. 
 So the Baby Boomers that were complaining about students wanting cheap tuition were really saying ""It was ok for our parents' generation to pay for our education, but today's young people don't deserve us doing that for them."" Claiming that you deserve more than others in your situation is pretty much the definition of entitlement IMO. 
 So that's why I consider some Baby Boomers to be ""retroactively entitled"".","Baby Boomers benefited from public programs paid by older generations when they were students. Today's students demand that the government maintain the policies that benefit young people. Some BBs realize that they would be paying for most of this, so they claim that today's youth don't deserve the same treatment they got 40 years or so ago."

AskReddit,caotaqu,"let me preface by saying: Death is my greatest fear. Simply the smell will tense me up all day, ready to fight or run. Not only my personal death, but the death of any living creature or person. 
 I'm not particularly religious, so when I die I figure my eyes will close, my heart will stop pumping, and my brain activity will slow and stop. The oxygen deprivation to my brain will cause the cells to die, losing their contained memories, emotions, and personality. In that sense, my entire being has been absorbed by death. Don't misunderstand me, I don't mean a soul or spirit, I mean my ""me""-ness is gone. Both literally and figuratively, I have been swallowed by death. 
 I'm gonna be a little figurative here, but I perceive death as black, viscous, all-consuming, although not particularly malicious. When I see a dead person, the seeping death is there, having taken what is rightfully its to take. Death peeks out of rib cages of animals, hiding behind glassy eyes. It floats through the air, on that so-distinct smell.

Which she forgot that a couple weeks earlier she got a flat so during my lunch hour I went out and fixed it using her spare. So I took mine out of my trunk and gave it to her. Still going apeshit, I tell her take me in your car to mine and Ill take my spare back and fix it. So she does. And looks at my car and can see I have a blown tire. She does not say shit the entire night but tries to play nice. Since then whenever I ask do you want the truth or the lie most people say neither. 
 Now yes I have done this before and told the truth which got me into trouble that I deserve either at work or home.

AskReddit,c6ta8vo,"I go to college 22 hours away from home, and unfortunately could only make it home for 10 days at the beginning of the past summer. On my 2nd to last day home I went to a popular dirt biking spot with one of my good friends.  This spot happens to be in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely zero cell service. My buddy and I got about 3 good hours of riding in, and decided to take a lunch break, as we sat on the tailgate of my truck we were watching a kid my age (20) ride the same line over and over again, hitting the same jump and taking a blind corner recklessly fast. While he is doing that, I noticed 2 kids on motorcycles and their dad on a four wheeler heading straight for the blind corner.  Graphic 
It all happened too fast to process, one of the kids ended up getting side swiped and merely tipped his dirtbike over, the other was hit full force from behind by the reckless rider, followed by the dad running both of them over with his fourwheeler and it somehow ending up rolling onto the reckless rider. There were only about 6 or 7 other people at the spot that day, and my buddy and I were the first to see it, so I sprinted about 200 yards to the scene of the wreck, the dad was tending to the kid who got hit from behind (he was about 11 or 12, coherent, his front teeth were smashed backwards into his mouth, blood was running like a faucet, his whole face was covered in blood) I looked over to rest of the scene, reckless riders helmet was shattered, he was spitting up blood, his lower half was trapped under the fourwheeler and his dirtbike.  I somehow managed to throw both machines off of this guy, and immediately stabilized his neck in my arms.  He was semi-conscious, but mostly because he was struggling to breathe. His legs were brutally convulsing which made it hard to keep him still. As I supported his head with my arm, I took his hand just held it tight, and knew I couldn't let him go unconscious. He was drifting in an out of sleep, and for about 15 minutes I supported and kept awake this kid that I was almost certain would die in my arms. Thankfully more riders had returned to the parking lot by this time and came over to help, one of them was his father who ended up taking over my job, I ran up a HUGE hill climb hill to scavenge for one bar of cell service to call 911.  Finally got ahold of them, he ended up getting Life Flighted to a major hospital where he was in a coma for a few weeks. From what I've heard is making a full recovery. According to the EMTs, he would have been dead if not for the first aid received.

AskReddit,chwwb2u,"A girl's first time having sex does not have to painful. If it is, you're probably going too fast or your dick is too big. She may also have a problem with her hymen not retracting or being too thick, which may require medical attention. Bleeding is not a sign of virginity: it is a sign of you hurting her. Sometimes it can't be avoided and it may not be the issue, but it is not required and should not be treated like the standard. A girl's hymen begins retracting around puberty and can be completely gone by her early to mid-20s, and it is possible to have sex without breaking the hymen. Also, plenty of activities besides sex (horseback riding is a big one, I believe) can break the hymen. Its presence (or lack thereof) is not a fail-proof indicator of virginity, especially the older a girl gets. 
 For guys that care about their girl's purity, this is a big deal. If you save yourselves for marriage and don't get married until your early 30s, your wife should not bleed on your wedding night. You should never expect or require your wife/girlfriend/partner to bleed or experience discomfort during sex, even their first time. She is the only person in the whole world who can with complete certainty say whether or not she is a virgin. 
 This is also an issue for girls, because fear of pain and bleeding can make their first time incredibly stressful, which increases the chances of such complications. Also, the importance put on a hymen as proof of virginity can discourage girls from anything they may consider a threat to it (like the aforementioned horseback riding, or using a tampon, which was a common theme in early tampon ads).",A girl bleeding during her first time is a sign of some sort of complication and not a good thing. A hymen is not a clear indicator of virginity.

 This happened about 15 years ago. I called my friend up and he wasn't home so I left a message on his answering machine. I said, ""Hey, it's me KILLALLEXTREMISTS. Sorry I missed you, call you later. Bye."" And then I hung up and left the house. I made no other calls. Later that day he called back and he says, ""Wow, that was quite a message you left. Who was that girl you were talking to?""

AskReddit,cgxthtb,"That's a complex issue to tackle, mainly because nobody can really say  exactly  why Hitler did it because the reasons were in his mind, which we can't access. 
 There are several factors likely at play: 
 1) Hitler had a  huge  fear and respect of the British. While they had less men, the British were a powerful war machine experienced at fighting against the Germans themselves. 
 2) Taking Northern Africa meant cutting off a lot of supply lines for all of the Allies that weren't the Soviets, meaning he was taking out several birds with one stone if he actually took it. 
 3) Oil. The Germans desperately needed oil in WWII, as did the British, and the African colonies would provide it to whoever held it. The lack of these colonies could very well have crippled the UK. 
 4) The Soviet campaign, while the second bloodiest of the war (the bloodiest being China/Japan), was going very well for the Germans at first. There was little reason to think things would get suddenly turned around like they were, and by the time they were, Rommel was already tangled up in North Africa and well established there. Hitler was extremely cocky when it came to the Soviets, allowing his troops to make moves further than they should have right before winter in 1941, and then doing it  again  in 1942, both of which opened up opportunities for massive counteroffensives (which the Soviets took). By the time those leading the Soviet campaign realized that they couldn't win the way they were fighting or even stalemate at that rate, Rommel had already been pulled from Africa and was helping plan the protection of France from the American/British forces (which were just as threatening, if not more, than the Soviets).

AskReddit,c8408lx,"I am not a hairdresser, but I have a story 
 The other day (on Halloween) I was getting my haircut at my usual place. I have a pretty simple cut, so I dont really care who does it. Just a two on the sides and short on the top. The guy who gets me is pretty new to the place and really rough with his clippers. Like hateful with them. Anyway, the cut is going fine and he is being pretty rough on the back when the unthinkable happens. The guard comes off the clippers and shaves off part of the top of my hair. 
 He tells me what happens and I assume he is kidding since it is Halloween and people like to joke around on that day. He tries his best to ""fade it in"" and I look terrible. I've been told I have a pretty mean face and that no matter what I do, I always look mad. So basically I look like a cholo (I am hispanic). I tell the guy that I can't go to work like that (company wants me to be presentable at all times) as I look like a thug and I just have him shave it all off. 
 Now this is where I get kind of mad because he had the audacity to tell me he was not going to charge me for it. This made me really mad because my job is in sales, and I already have to deal with always looking angry even when I am not. And a shaved head gives me a ""fresh from prison"" look. The shaved head did look better than the fade because the guy just wasn't that good at haircuts. 
 The reason it made me so mad, was because I don't think he had to acknowledge that I wasn't going to pay for it because I absolutley was not going to give him a single cent for ruining my halloween plans (My get up was dependent on having some hair) and ruining the next six weeks while my hair grew back at work.

Girls would ask me if i straightened my hair and I would scowl at them while refuting their claim. My new hair was controlling my life. I became catlike.

AskReddit,ckky7db,"In second grade I had a techer that  HATED  me.  Now I'm sure you've heard that line before, but this is undisputable, after what my parents have told me she said to them while I was in that class.  She was the type of teacher who was all to ready to find any fault in a child, and mistook my ability to learn the lesson, and then be bored when she went over it 3 or 4 times, as me having some sort of disorder.  For example, she told my parents in a private conference that, and I quote, ""There is something wrong with your son.  He doesn't want to focus at all during review time, and generally appears to be zoned out during class.  I think it's a good time to start Ritalin.""  My parents were appaled.  This bitch had just tried to prescribe Ritalin to a seven-year old, with no testing or anything of that nature.  She turned out to be completely wrong, as I went on to score in the top 1% of the STAR test that year, and proceeded to be a GATE student for the rest of elementary school.  My third grade teacher was a godsend for this matter, and I can never thank her enough. 
 Now to the real, and arguably lamer, story.  My best friend happened to be just like me in the learning sense, so he began to stare off blankly in class, or fidget around, things of that nature.  Over time, we kind of noticed that niether of us were paying attention, but still never really talked much.  One day, he and I were trying to see who could lean the farthest back in our chair wothout tipping over. Now before I say anything I will admit that we were both little shitheads, but that still doesn't warrant the reaction that came from my teacher after what happened next. 
 As he was leaning back, a bolt on the bottom of his chair broke, due to the immense stress it was under, and he toplled back like a ton of bricks, making a massive comotion, and banging his hands against the desk behind him as he fell.  Now here is what appals me (which is arguably the reason I remember it so well).  My teacher, instead of doing as a teacher should, and checking to see if he was alright, went off on the kid.  I'm talking a solid 5 minutes of uninterrupted vocal abuse.  She said many things that you simply shouldn't say to a second grader, but at least there were no profanities. 
 At the time, I was only sitting a few desks away, so I decided to jump over and help him back up, you know, like a normal human being would.  This somehow brought me into her crosshairs, and I received a decent ammount of rage as well. 
 When the day was over, and we had both lost our recess privileges, he invited me over to his house (which was conveniently about 100 feet from the school). When my mom came to pick me up, I asked her if I could go over to a friends house for a while, and with her saying yes, I gained my best friend. 
 Neither of us have told our parents about this, and the teacher has since retired, so I really see no point in telling anyone anymore.  Even though she was a right bitch, I can't thank my second grade teacher enough, for giving me my best friend.","Second grade teacher is a psycho bitch, and because of that, I got a best friend."
AskReddit,c7z6gb6,"I've seen this be asked on Reddit so many times I want to throw my laptop out the window every time. But, I get the confusion if you're not a part of the industry and you're just the consumer. I'm a fashion designer - I do both pret-a-porter as well as experimental collections so I can tell you know this works from the fashion industry's point of view; 
 Designers are not artists. Never will be. If you do art, you do art. If you're a designer, you're a fucking designer. Because with art you express your own ego, whereas in design you think of the person who is going to own your piece. There is a fine line between the two though and it's getting more and more confusing lately, I'll give you that. 
 The experimental collections (what you call bizarre outfits) are not art and you should not confuse it with it. What they are though, is experimenting in an industry, that's basically invented everything that's to be invented. It's a way to express a raw concept in an interesting and exciting way. I think someone likened it to a concept car - very good comparison, only in fashion it's much more important. I always say it's like presenting my sketchbook in 3D. 
 Collection showcases (fashion shows) of such designers are usually for people who are there to catch onto trends and new ideas, concepts (bigger companies, Topshop, H&M, Zara) that they can use. I can guarantee you that any bizarre piece you see on a show is going to be slowly, slowly trickled down into something you will wear. All of us. Usually takes a season or two. There's plywood on his face? You're gonna wear a T-shirt with some wood printed on it in a year or so, or perhaps a bag that has a fake wood imprint on the leather. Oh, Urban Outfitters is going to have a blast with that. She's wearing a strange, bloated dress? Oversize is going to come back into fashion. Etc. 
 I do this too - I make an experimental collection, get it all out of my system and make a wacky show - then offer my customers something simpler (""Oh you loved that oversize black and white coat? how about I make you a simple tailored dress with the exact same fabric?"") Because the customer was interested and excited by the clothes that were on the show, but wants something similar that he/she could wear. They would not be interested if the show was full of 'ordinary' clothes. 
 It's how it works. I think most people underestimate the fashion/clothing industry by saying 'It's just clothes' or 'Who the fuck would wear that'. It makes over a trillion dollars a year and it's a big part of our lives because you use it every single day of your life. It's exciting and complicated and insane at the same time.","It's not that bizarre. You will be wearing it, in some way or another. 
 EDIT: Also, I see people mentioning haute couture; this is something else, not experimental collections. They are beautiful collection crafted and sewn almost entirely by hand. They're defined by the amount of work put into then. There are only a few real haute couture designers (acknowledged by the committee) in the world.

 2) Sniping is not nearly as easy or practical as movies would have you believe. Shots from long distances require expertise and are very difficult to pull off.

 I'm in grade 12, chilling with this girl I really like. We're on spare and it's May so we're hanging out with a couple friends on a playground near the school. Have a blast, it's all good. I'm going to ask her out, don't, and get a sunburn. 
 Good news though, later that night we're both back at the school for this Anti-Tobacco fundraiser open mic. I actually get the balls to ask her out this time, to prom, but not ""as-friends"". She looks really troubled and asks to think about it. I say sure. 
 I miss school the next day because, wouldn't you know it, I also have the goddamn chicken pox. A week before my 18th birthday.

 After being told I wasn't good enough for the girl I thought I was sure I would marry, in March of this year I quit my full time job I despised, and decided to tag along with my family on a vacation to Italy.  After 7 days they went home and I went to Barcelona by myself to do some proverbial soul searching.  I don't know Spanish much less so Catalan, I live in a tiny little state, and I've never been far outside the east coast let alone the U.S., nor had I had an inkling of travelling alone. 
 So 2 days into my 5 days in Barcelona I decided to try this Tinder app my friends were telling me about because I was lonely and in a foreign country and not enjoying myself as much as I thought I would.  End up talking to a woman in her 30's (I'm 26, male) who lives in Barca but speaks English.  We messaged for a day or so then decided to meet up. 
 She gave me an address of a ""a bar where my gay friend is.""  So I get there by myself around 22:00, and, you guessed it, it's a gay disco. I had no means of communication save the disco's wi-fi (thank gawd) and I found her after 10 minutes of 'Lo siento, no habla' and avoiding ass grabs, and being on the brink of bailing. She immediately gave me a kiss for my efforts. 
 We danced our asses off to Spanish songs and Spice Girls with all her gay friends (I was alone in Barcelona with a beautiful woman, I didn't give a fuck what I was dancing to.)  We went back to my apartment  and made love til the sun came up. I shared a cigarette with her afterwards as we both stood naked on balcony looking at the Mediterranean Sea and the and the streetlight cascaded perfectly across her breasts. She went to work the next day and we reconvened immediately after and drank and talked and told each other our secrets and made love all night again.  I had to leave to catch my flight at 4am the next morning. I walked down the streets of Barceloneta with not a soul stirring trying to remind myself that this was not a dream and all this perposterous joy just fell upon me.

AskReddit,cqbdfhp,"I oftentimes don't get along with other women, and never quite understood the causes until I took to the time to do some introspection. For me, it often feels like as soon as I am expected to interact with a woman who is a stranger in a social situation (a friend's girlfriend, for example), I feel like I didn't get the instruction manual as to how that social interaction should start. 
 Women often interact with each other slightly differently than men interact with each other, or than men and women interact with each other. When I was in highschool, I had a close knit group of female friends who ended up bullying me (telling stories, manipulating relationships so other friends would leave), and it made me distrustful. I unconsciously started making more friends with guys, and I learned those social interactions (roughhousing, lewd jokes, very masculine interactions, as opposed to classically female interactions such as sharing intimacies or increased physical contact). 
 As a result now, I am far better at my interpersonal interactions with men than I am with women. 
 I think my sexuality is also an influential factor, as I am bisexual, and I know that this could make some women very uncomfortable if they knew. Women in close situations, such as at work or at each other's houses, will sometimes do things like change in front of each other. I've even had this happen at work. I don't want someone to feel victimised because they hugged me, or changed in front of me, or asked me to fix their bra strap, and then found out that I'm bisexual. 
 I think this causes a secondary panic and I just shut down. Guys assume that a girl that looks like I do (very classically female) may be attracted to them, so that's already on the table. And then I know how to punch someone in the shoulder a hell of a lot better than I know how to deal with more intimate interactions. 
 I don't say any of these things to negate the diversity of all sorts of women and men. Everyone is an individual at the end of it, but I do think that there are more typical behaviours for each gender. 
 I get fucking nervous if my boyfriend and I are going out and we are meeting his friend's new girlfriend. I am so damn scared of messing up that social interaction, I think it's entered into the realm of social anxiety.","I struggle to make close friendships with other women because I'm scared my sexuality may make them feel victimised, and because I was bullied by other girls as a teenager."

 I used to work in a nursing home. One day, I had a resident refuse to get on the elevator with me, citing ""being scared of the little boy"" as her reason. I shrugged it off until I had a resident come out of his room and ask me for ""candy for the little boy."" I decided to ask my mom, charge nurse and employee of 13 years, about what had been happening. 
 She told me that all through her years of employment, residents periodically reported seeing a young boy. He was always wanting to play. He appeared to all kinds of residents, from those of sound mental status to those with severe dementia. They all reported the exact same thing, over a great period of time. When they moved to a new facility, the little boy came with them. The little boy was particularly fond of those with limited sight. From those residents, the boy was described as having dark black hair, that he lived out in a ""tent,"" and he said that he died when a tree fell on him.

AskReddit,c23a97e,"I have a somewhat similar story to this. 
 Back in High School and to this day, I've always had the righteous need to protect people who get picked on for no reason. As a result, I would hang out with the all the nerdy kids in High School. There was this one kid, Robby, who was about as awkward as you can get in High School. He basically looks like  Bubbles . 
 Anyways, I befriended this kid because he was a genuinely nice guy aside from being extremely socially awkward. He'd sit with my friends and I at lunch and we'd talk between classes but I made it a point to never hang out with him outside of school because he made me a bit nervous in all honesty. I'm not a small guy by any means but I'm big either but I never let any of the jocks or rednecks push me around. I use to beat up anyone who messed with me but not to the point of hurting them, do scare tactic shit like punching dents into their lockers, etc. when they messed with my friends or I. 
 They tortured Robby RELENTLESSLY when I wasn't around as I was the only person who stood up for him. They'd slam his locker when he had his hands or arms in it, grab his fat and jiggle it, trip him, smack his books down, punch him in the back of the head, you name it. I think what made it worse is that he would try to stop them by going after them when they did this stuff but he had no way of defending himself. So, one day when we're at lunch in our Senior year of High School and he's just sitting their quietly eating his food and he says ""You guys need to stay home from school tomorrow. I'm going to kill everyone in the school."" completely deadpan and with a small smile on his face. He then goes on to describe how he has a bunch of his dad's guns and ammo packed up in a duffle bag at his house and that he's going to come to school and walk into a class that he knows most of the kids that pick on him are in and take them out. We laughed, of course, thinking he was joking and he laughed and said he was joking but after lunch I pulled him aside and asked if he was serious. He told me he was and he knew that I would believe him and I asked him to go over his plan again. I had a nicer phone so before he started explaining it again I turned on the record app and put my phone back in my pocket so I could get it on tape. After he was done I flipped it off and told him to wait for me after school because I wasn't done talking about it. After school, I told him I wanted to help him get revenge on these kids but helping him kill them for picking on my friends and I over the years too but we needed to plan it out better and make sure we could make  everyone  suffer and not just get some of them. He agreed and we parted ways. 
 The second he was out of sight I marched into the school office and went straight to the principal and told him what was going on. I played the recording in which I directed Robby to tell me the plan so he knew it was actually him and not someone else and after it was over the principal just sat their quiet for a second and said he'd call the police. My friends and I found out later that he was arrested the second he got off the bus that same day and was taken to a Psych ward somewhere in Kansas City. 
 I actually ran into the kid later in life and he approached me and talked to me saying he knew it was me who turned him in and that we was glad that I did it. He had gotten the help he needed and he was doing great now, working alongside his father in their family business, he had a girlfriend, etc. I was scared to fucking death he was going to gut me or something but, obviously, he didn't and he said thanks and that I did the right thing and that he's glad I did because it saved his life. It was the strangest scenario and it was also the last time I've seen him thus far.","Went to school with a nerdy guy who got picked on.

 When I was a Sophomore in high school, this girl I liked invited me and about ten other guys and girls in our class to her mom's apartment one night when her mom was out of town. 
 One of the ""cooler"" guys, Hector, told me earlier in the day that he was going to try to get drunk there. I had never drank alcohol before, but I had an older brother who was old enough to buy liquor, so I thought I could make myself look cool by bringing a bunch of beer. I get there about 9PM, and find, to my dismay, everyone is pissed at me for bringing beer, with the exception of Hector, who is already drunk. The girl tells me not to bring the beer inside, so Hector and I go downstairs to a table in the grassy park area of the apartment complex. We each open a beer, and Hector, who is inexplicably paranoid about getting caught underage drinking, says to me, 
 ""Man, I swear if I see any cops I am going to bolt."" 
 I take one sip of my beer, my first sip of a beer ever, and look up. Behind Hector, about a hundred yards away in the parking of the complex, I see flashing police lights. I tell Hector to look. He sees the lights, turns back to me with a panicked look on his face, and then starts running. Frenetic and scared, I just start running too, following Hector. 
 We run out to the other parking lot, adjacent to a major street, and as we are running East, we see a line of police cars speeding West down the major street toward the complex. They turn in to the parking lot and one car speeds straight toward Hector and myself. Hector darts right, I dart left, and the cop car follows me to a dead end. The driver exits the vehicle, draws gun, and screams for me to get on the ground. I do so, and am handcuffed and roughly thrown in the back of a police car. 
 I'm in the car for about ten minutes when the cop comes back and pulls me out. He starts rubbing my knuckles. 
 ""Do you knuckles hurt? Do your hands hurt? Why don't you tell us about what happened tonight son? You been getting into fights tonight?"" 
 I seriously have no idea what's going on at this point. I'm put back in the car. Ten more minutes and the officer comes back, now with more officers. 
 ""Why are you lying to us? You're only making the situation worse. We showed the kid you beat up your I.D. and he identified you. Why don't you just tell the truth?"" 
 At this point I'm seriously like WTF. 16 years old, never been in trouble, first time EVER drinking, and about to piss my pants. I'm pulled out of the cop car and another cop car shines it's spotlight on me. After a few minutes, a cop comes back. 
 ""You're lucky son, he said it wasn't you. Where do you live?"" 
 The cop proceeds to take me home, explaining along the way that they were there because of a crazy party in that complex (completely separate from the small get together I was going to) got really out of hand and a few guys got jumped and bloodied up pretty bad. Apparently one of the victims was shown my I.D. and in his concussed state identified me as the attacker. The cop brings me home to my mom's house, and my older brother answers the door with a look of sheer fright-- he had warrants for his arrest at the time and thought I had ratted him out for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. My mom came and talked to the cop while my brother went and hid in the other room. The cop basically just told my mom not to let her son drink and that I was an idiot.

 It all started when I was going to college and working at Wal Mart. I was a cashier and a couple times they put me at the cosmetics counter when the regular girl didn't show up. (and for the record, I'm a guy, and I was the only guy working most of these nights and I found out later that the reason I was picked to take over in cosmetics was because I was the least likely to steal makeup) Anyway I'm working the counter in cosmetics and this girl comes up and asks me ""why do they only have male only WWF Superstar Calendars and female only WWF Superstar calendars, and not ones with both?""

 After that I started seeing this girl around wal mart a lot. Eventually I noticed that every time i saw her she was staring at me. Then I guess she caught on that her staring was making me uncomfortable, so she started hiding in the clothes racks by my till and staring at me. Then after a few weeks of that she worked up the courage to come and talk to me, and would say the weirdest shit and get all territorial when a female coworker came over to talk. At the time I was engaged and living with my fiancee and her 2 female friends, one of which worked with me. She noticed this girl, whose name was Echo, always around and this created suspicions among my fiancee and her friends. Luckily I explained myself and both my roommates met her and realized she was a complete nutjob.

AskReddit,clhvet2,"I'm copying a comment I made in another post, since it seems to work here too. 
 
 My SO of 2 years and I had to break up a while ago, and it's still been on my mind. 
 We were living in two different states, and couldn't see each other as much as we'd like. More importantly, we were spending all our free time trying to meet up or spend time online, when we needed to focus on getting steady work. 
 I was/am still living with my folks, and she was almost completely reliant on her roommate for support. Hard to keep a relationship going when you're barely keeping out of dept and living so far apart. 
 Eventually she found work even further away, but I'm too rooted where I am while I save up. So it was agreed that we just couldn't go on together with things as they were. 
 It was just a crappy situation we could do nothing about. We broke up for all the right reasons, and we knew we still loved each other. And that's what makes it all so hard. 
 We still keep in touch somewhat, and she seems to be doing well. But with all the good things happening for her, I can't help but feel a bit.....resentful. Jealous. Maybe even abandoned. I learned that she is with someone now, and she seems happy. 
 And I wish that I could feel happy that someone I love is finally making her way in the world. But the idea that she is so far away, being happy without me, possibly bring held in another's arms was nothing short of torturous. 
 One day at work I had to violently shake my head every few minutes to drown out the thoughts of her being with someone else. I pushed myself harder that day just so I would become distracted and exhausted. Physical pain seemed preferably to emotional. 
 Thankfully, after a nights sleep, the pain began to subside. I wasn't as upset, and found I could go to work without the thoughts of her causing me distress, and the same was true for today. It still makes me tremendously sad at times, but I feel much more in control of myself than I did while I was wallowing. 
 I don't know if it's smart to stay in touch with her (since I'm afraid of holding either of us back by trying to stay together), but I know cutting her completely out of my life would be even worse. It's stupid, I know. But I also know that had our financial and professional situations been further developed when we met, there is no doubt in my mind that I would have stayed with her for the rest of my life.","SO and I broke up for all the right reasons, but still feel the pain of the loss.

Bitch girl who picked on me walks in with her water bottle. Not 30 seconds later, two cops walked into the door and arrested her. She had brought vodka to school and held it in the water bottle. Word was, her own friends ratted her out. She was expelled from my high school and I never saw her again. One of the best justices I've witnessed.",Bitch who made fun of me got expelled for bring vodka to school.
AskReddit,c1ou7sl,"Signs"" is the worst. Smart aliens with the ability to travel to earth are killed by water and have taken no precautions against water! First, the earth's atmosphere has a high water concentration, even when its not raining, so wouldn't the humidity on earth kill them?  Second, even assuming you need a 100% humidity rate (liquid water) to harm them, wouldn't an alien species be aware that the most common thing on the planet is lethal to them and wear a shield of some type?  Wouldn't they test this before landing!","Aliens in ""Signs"" are killed by water, but come to Earth with tons of water and no protection against it

AskReddit,c7iu4lu,"Went to the beach to celebrate a friend's birthday. There were 4 girls with us, two of whom were a lesbian couple. They didn't bring any bathing suits so they just went into the water with their regular clothes. My friend was the driver, but he started puking. His seat's stuck all the way back and I'm the only one tall enough to drive now. I haven't driven for a year since I got my license because I'm too poor for insurance. It was getting pretty late and it got cold, so the girls decided to strip naked and get in the car because they were freezing. There was also a giant thunderstorm and I couldn't see more than 10 feet in front of my face, plus there were no reflective surfaces on the highway we were on. So now I'm driving with 0 experience through the biggest fucking thunderstorm, destroying all visibility, with 4 attractive naked chicks in the back, 2 of whom were making out. I was fucking terrified. Ended up hydroplaning and spinning 2 and a half times at which point I said fuck it and we went to a truck stop waiting out the storm.","no driving experience, heavy thunderstorm, hot naked chicks making out, still decided to drive over 100 miles home"
AskReddit,circw4x,"I have a story to tell. I met a kindergarten teacher on Tinder. We hit it off and text. But she lives an hour and a half across town so she asks if I want to meet up in her part of town that weekend for a movie and signs off the conversation with a sexy titpic. GOD BLESS TEACHERS. I am SO getting laid. 
 As the weekend approaches things get more sexual and I ask if she has any fantasies she has ever wanted to try. She tells me she has always wanted to fuck in a movie theater. Well seeing as we already have a movie date planned I tell her I am down for anything. She responds with another nude. pussypic. KINKY. This is going to be fucking awesome. 
 The weekend arrives and I road-trip across town guzzling BAJA BLAST and jamming pump-up tunes fighting shitty traffic. Nothing gets me down because this is going to be legendary. I meet up with her at the mall and she does a slow crawl drive ensuring I'm not catfishing her and I am not a psycho. Passed her test and climb into her SUV. She is decked to the nines in slutty heels, a skirt and leggings and deep cleavage top. SHE WANTS IT. She lays out the plan for me. She has the perfect theater in mind the town over where no one will recognize her in the off chance things go south. 
 We get to the theater in Bum-fuck no where; not my part of town. I am in unknown territory. She says she picked this theater because its hardly ever crowded and always really dark. So we shouldn't have any problems fooling around incognito. Little does she know when we arrive the theater has turned into a fucking Megaplex in the 5 years since she was last there: Imax screens, boutique ice cream stand inside and another 2 floors added. And PACKED. Bum-fuck no where likes its movies. We go up to buy tickets at the box office. She is panicking. I think fast and run the list of movies through my head that are playing. What would have very few people, was showing ASAP and give us the best chance to mess around without getting caught. RIO 2? No. Dick flashing children is bad. NOAH? Too biblical. What's left? BRICK MANSIONS. Luc Besson flick hollywoodized. B/C grade action movie no one has heard of starring PAUL WALKER. Perfect. She buys the tickets, gives me a wink and we head to the theater. 
 We get inside and head to the second to last row and sit in the first two seats. 6 other couples in the theater. All in the bottom rows except 2 bros on the far side of the theater in our row. 10 minutes to show time. WE GOT THIS. Time crawls as we anxiously glare at every couple entering. 2 more. climbing up row after row enter 2 below us. We breathe a sigh of relief. She reaches down and grabs my crotch. I look over and she gives me a shifty grin and a wink. IT'S ON. The lights dim and the previews start to roll. 2 more people enter and start walking up to us. FUCK FUCK FUCK staccatos through my head as Optimus Prime blows shit up on screen. The couple hooks a quick left and sits down. PERFECT. We quickly get up and move to the back of the last row in the theater and in from the aisle stairs so we are alone in the very back of the theater. Coffin Corner. She leans in and whispers: ""this is making me so WET. See?"" She grabs my hand and puts it down the front of her leggings. FUCKING SOAKED. I am ROCK hard. She kisses me hard on the mouth as MARK WAHLBERG flexes underneath an American Flag. 
 Its only semi dark in the theater at this point, but she says she cant wait. She is eyeing my bulge with intent to thrill. I whip off my belt like INDIANA JONES and silently thank MICHAEL BAY that the entire preview is explosions. Unzip my fly and she grabs my cock before I can even fully get my pants down. Like LONDON BRIDGE falling down she gulps my cock before I fully clear my briefs. And she starts going HAM on my dick. I am leaning back surveying my kingdom and fully surreal that I am getting domed in the back of a movie theater. Midday. Half light. And she doesn't give a fuck. AWESOME. She comes up for air and says: ""I am gushing. This is SO FUCKING HOT!"" I nod and grin stupidly. She starts to jack me off. Unsatisfied with the amount of lubrication from her spit, she stares me dead in the eyes as she reaches between her thighs, under the leggings and scoops against her pussy and then grabs my cock. Speechless at this point I gape at her as she starts to jack me off with the most natural/unnatural lube I've ever experienced during an HJ. Noticing my dumbfounded look she smirks and replies ""Hope you don't mind, I had to improvise. Don't want you chafed for later."" 
 She continues to alternately suck, jerk, and juice-scoop her pussy to bring me closer and closer to climax. I pulled down her top and started sucking on her tits. The previews wind down but she is intent on the job at hand and doesn't notice. A loud SLURPPP punctures the sudden silence before the movie begins and we both freeze. Her leaning over me, cock in mouth while I'm staring down to see if anyone notices anything. NOTHING. She slowly continues her trifecta of scoop, jerk, suck, repeat. Ticking me closer and closer to exploding. I'm thanking Hollywood for opening the movie with 15 minutes of machine guns and a screeching car chase as she cant help match intensity and pace to the action scene she can't even see. Just unconsciously bobbing her head and moving to the beat of a MAC-10. THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME.  She edges me closer and closer till right when I'm about to explode PAUL WALKER emerges from cover and in a salvo of bullets shoots to kill as I explode shooting my whole clip into her mouth pace for pace with the movie. 4D never felt so immersive as I give a full gun salute to a fallen cinema hero's last movie. Valar Morghulis. ALL MEN MUST DIE. I've never felt more manly or American. I can't think of a better tribute. Until I see movement out of the corner of my eye and see the 2 frat bros in the row below giving me a thumbs up from across the theater. YES. I AM THE MAN. I send the thumbs up back. 
 ... 
 Mid movie she wants more. I've been jellyfish for about 15 minutes. Post-gasm-fog still shrouding my brain so I can't comprehend fully the logistics she is whispering in my ear on how I can fuck her. I shake out of it and nut up. She moves in front of me, pulls down her leggings and tilts the back of her skirt over her ass. She's dripping. She reaches back for my D and wants it. BAD. I look around to check if the coast is clear. But at this point the wrong head is screaming FUCK IT. I proceed to fuck her doggy-style over the back row of the seats as she barely attempts to stifle moans as I pound into her from behind. Machine Guns continue and honestly that's the only thing you can fucking hear. Unreal. This movie was perfect. 
 I fuck her until she climaxes and she gushes all over my DICK. HOUSTON WE HAVE A SQUIRTER. We ride out the rest of a semi-shitty translation of a film in a dopamine haze of sex and paranoia. Our Adrenals were fucked.

AskReddit,che1bul,"I did absolutely terrible in K-12, average GPA of 0.75 - 1.25. Before I graduated (around 10th or 11th grade) I ended up going into a vocational school program that would get me college credits and high school credits at the same time. I didn't do a whole lot of the college work (computer programming) but I did end up doing the high school work. The high school work had deadlines, the college work didn't. 
 At age 20 I ended up accidentally getting too many credits and graduating high school, which meant I would have to pay for the vocational/college to keep going. So I dropped out. 
 After about 6 months of playing WoW (haven't played since) and nothing else I went back to college. Community college this time, for software development. That was about 2009. I did fairly well in the general stuff (philosophy, English, etc). I did way better in math/physics/programming classes. Did two years there then transferred to a local university for my other two years. 
 Last summer I graduated with the second highest GPA of all the computer science majors graduating that year, honors and all that. Sat around playing video games for about 4 months then started looking for a job, got hired at the first place I applied where I'm typing this out now.",Not doing well in high school doesn't seem to dictate your future.
AskReddit,c8sfanh,"That reminds me of when my folks moored our boat out in the lake, and went home. Well mooring isn't that common here. So a DNR agent sees the boat anchored no occupants, no note, and worries he may have multiple drowning victims. Somehow which makes me nervous, they get my cell number, my sisters, my parents, our adress. They called my folks first and their phone was off so it made them more worried. So I start getting calls from 911 dispatch. I slept through them, my sister gets the same calls but her phone is in her car because she's at work. 
 Cops show up at our house and beat on the door, I still keep sleeping, my dog wakes me up barking and I just yell shut the fuck up multiple times roll over and pass back out. Finally they tracked my sisters work number down contacted her there, telling her they think our folks drowned she leaves work without notifying anybody.

AskReddit,cr0ssyr,"Most high production countries - think G8 or G12 economies - have fairly effective taxing systems.  The US system has many, many ways to get away with paying less than their fair piece of the pie - most of these legal cheats are for rich people, but everyone has some.  but you can't get away with simply not filing, or filing but not paying.  Why? 
 As someone currently in hock to the IRS... they're effective. 
 When you make money, there's a paper record.  If you're an employee, your employer deducts estimated taxes from each paycheck; they forward those funds to federal, state, and local tax agencies.  At the end of the year when they file taxes, your information is sent along with that - that's when you get your W-2 income form. 
 Now, they have that information, but they won't act on it until you file.  Technically, if you never file and never do anything else that could cause auditing, you could avoid the IRS indefinitely - but you lose any money due to you as a refund and it massively limits your ability to apply for jobs, loans, or anything else really. 
 When you file taxes, they know where you are and what you owe.  If you don't pay, they'll send you lots of happy little reminders how much you owe and how much interest you're accruing.  If you wait long enough they can file a Levee against any funds in a US bank account and seize them.  They can also garnish wages.  If it gets bad enough, there's even jail time - ask Wesley Snipes. So there's incentive to set up a deal. 
 Really, they're just about the easiest creditor to deal with.   For reference, I did independent contracting full time 2006-2008, and ^ cough  never filed, because I hadn't saved any money.  I was dumb.  08-09 economic downturn made me suddenly insolvent.  It took a few years, but basically I got my paperwork together with the help of a tax person and said  I will pay you $x per month until it's paid off  and they were like  no prob bro . 
 Their interest rates are fairly low, and they aren't too picky about how much you pay per month as long as it's reasonable.","The IRS is like a golem with a task.  It's slow, but... YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE, MISTER MOIST."

 OK this happened a year before I was born but my mom loves to tell this story. So my parents had just moved into my childhood home and were having both my uncles over for drinks and whatnot. They had been given a christmas cactus as a gift and mom had it on display in the bathroom. We will come back to that. So my uncle shows up with his buddy Ray that nobody knows but it's cool because my uncle is cool and doesn't hang around with hooligans. 
 This is usually when my dad chimes in the story and says something about how Ray had the crazy eyes. 
 So my uncle shows up with a stranger who has the crazy eyes but is otherwise pretty chill. So everybody is hanging out talking and drinking a bit and Ray asks to use the bathroom. He's gone for a bit but nobody pays any mind.

AskReddit,cmhavgl,"I'm a railwayman, let me sing you the song of my people. 
 The railway was designed and built in Britain during the 1800's by hundreds of companies. By the 1923, they had been incorporated into 4 large private companies (Great Western Railway, London and North Eastern Railway, London Midland and Scottish and Southern Railway- Other companies existed too, like Southern Railway). These were nationalised in 1947. Whilst they were nationalised, the railway network received decent investment including dieselisation and new signalling systems were developed. By the mid-1950's, it was decided the railway was costing the taxpayer too much, so the government sought to close a lot of the railway and invest in road haulage (This brought along our motorways). Between 1958 and 1993, there was no investment whatsoever and the 1993 Conservative government under John Major chose to privatise the ENTIRE system, therefore bring money back to the taxpayer. 
This saw the infrastructure under a company named Railtrack and the operating trains under several franchises. Railtrack collapsed following 2 high profile incidents (Derailments which killed a lot of people). It was soon decided that public infrastructure could not exist as a private venture, so Network Rail was created by the government too look after the track, signalling, stations and bridges. Network Rail is now in £33bn debt after modernising the railway network. Very little money gets injected back in - the profits from the train operating companies would be the money which would have modernised it all - hence the call for total nationalisation.",Victorian railway infrastructure with little investment means we cannot be Japanese.
AskReddit,c82tdef,"With well over 2500 comments already I'm sure this will be buried but here's my true story semi summarized. This was back when I was in the 7th grade in Gary, Indiana. My mom she moved in with our grandmother and my brother and I shared bunk beds, him bottom and me top (no homo heh); these were the type of bunk beds where the bottom was a full and the top was the smaller twin. 
 So time passes, my grandma moves to L.A and my brother takes her study room and I just stay in our old room with the beds. One night while sleeping alone in the top bunk of the bed, I instantly wake up and I wake up completely frozen in fear and my body paralyzes while my eyes are wide open. Out of nowhere, this little white kid just fucking appears in my room ( It's important to acknowledge his color because Gary is predominately Black.

 I have never experienced such fear in my life! He then starts sprinting around my room, running back and forth, back and forth. Then, he begins to climb the ladder on my bunkbed coming to the top bunk where I am laying. I can feel the bed shaking just as a person is climbing the bed. He then gets in bed with me and just lays behind me. I can feel him breathing on my neck; though, I can't actually feel the air coming out of his mouth. 
 He lays with me for around 20 seconds, and it feels like an eternity. He then gets up, climbs back down the ladder, runs around and around, panting hard and rushed. He runs back towards the bed, climbs the ladder, jumps in bed with me again and this time lays even closer to me and I can feel him looking at me from behind. He stays this time in bed even longer. 
 He then jumps up again, down the ladder, running and running. He then just stops... he looks me right in the face,  I can hear him walking towards me. He then stops right by my face and stares at me. He then steps back a few steps, laughs and dissapears.",I'm fucked to this day due to a white kid ghost

AskReddit,cdvy154,"When I found out the reason for my parents' divorce. They divorced when I was one, and my mom (who is pretty much the most angelic person I know) refused to tell me why growing up, always saying, ""I'll tell you when you're older."" I just figured they didn't get along. Well one day on a road trip with my step grandma (my new step dad's mom), she spilled the beans when she told my sister and I how amazing it is that my mom would forgive my dad after what he did. Confused, I asked, ""What are you talking about? Forgive him for what?"" And she's like, ""You know, for cheating on her."" 
 I can't begin to describe how shattering that revelation was, as a naive 12-year-old who loved and admired both his parents so much. When I got home I asked my mom if it was true, and she confirmed that it was. She hadn't told me because she didn't want me to have negative feelings toward my dad or step mom. As it turned out, during my parents' marriage, my step mom, who had been my step mom as long as I could remember, was actually my dad's secretary and mistress (so cliché, I know). My mom found out when my step mom got pregnant with my younger half brother. My dad then divorced my mom (with whom he already had three kids) and married his secretary/mistress, who is now my step mom. 
 For several months I refused to talk to my dad. I was furious at him for abandoning us, for hurting my mom so deeply, and for not being man enough to tell us himself. But to the credit of my angel mom's example, I eventually moved on and forgave him. Still boggles my mind how forgiving my mom was. She always wanted us to spend time with our dad growing up, never spoke a word of unkindness about my dad or step mom, and is pretty much the reason I have two wonderful family environments that function harmoniously together.

AskReddit,c3020xs,"While i was at school my friends & i would often have underwear dance parties. They were always a lot of fun & usually resulted in some sort of costume contest/something of the sort. One night we were drinking at a friend's house just outside of campus... after a few rounds, it quickly became another underwear party. Not sure why, but a water fight developed out of the near nudity & people were starting to get dragged into the showers & thrown in.  It was at this point that the knock on the door came... everyone scrambled into the back room as the girl renting the house answered the door. 
 Almost directly after answering the door, the girl slips on a puddle of water that had accumulated from the fight that had taken place prior & starts crying her eyes out. The rest of the party takes this as a great opportunity to flee into the heavily wooded backyard to hide in case the police decided to investigate the house further. so, our small gang, half dressed & dripping wet, sneak out and start hiding in the brush & behind trees. 
 Apparently while this was happening the cops had managed to calm our friend & ask her what was going on, & why she had a diaper hanging on her wall (yes, there was a diaper party at one point... i didnt attend). She told them something like she had been cleaning & accidentally spilled a bunch of water or something equally as unbelievable. They asked to check the rest of the house & stepped out the back to shine a flashlight around before leaving. 
 After it was safe we all emerged from the woods & started dancing again. Later in the night we realized that the curtains at the front of the house had been wide open & that the cops had probably witnessed everything that had happened... we also lost a friend briefly, as he had went & hid in the basement & didnt know that the cops had left... he emerged again shortly after he heard dancing footsteps again.",hid in the woods after the cops busted our underwear danceparty/water fight
AskReddit,c2tjh8t,"Alright this one is pretty complex and involves a hamster so bear with me.  I had a hamster container that consisted of a fish tank with a plastic roof and a small clear sliding lid in the center to easily access the interior of the aquarium without removing the suction cups which were affixed to the glass sides like this [one](  The interior contained normal hamster stuff, bedding, toys,... but what the hamster had utilized was a metal wire running wheel, a cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper, and bedding. 
 I went on break  and left my father in charge of the hamster; when I came home my father said the hamster had escaped at some point and that he had found the hamster a couple of days later on his night stand just staring at him when he woke up.  I thought my he was just pulling my leg, but a couple of nights later I was awoken by the hamsters' super awesome escape plan.  So what he did was put the card board tube between the spokes of the metal wheel to prevent it from making a full revolution allowing him to climb to the top of the wheel.  There was also a substantial amount of bedding crammed underneath the wheel, I assume this is because the hamster needed to stably stand on top of the wheel; as standing a bit past center of the wheel opposite the side he climbed up would send the wheel rolling.  So while on top of the wheel, he stood on his hind legs and grabbed the clear plastic lid in the center of the aquarium topper, pulled the lid back then pulled his body right out of the tank. 
 I was quite amazing.  Then after we would spend whole weekends together while I would test his intelligence with homemade mazes and puzzles.  I also taught him an array of things after that. I loved that hamster, he lived to be 3 years old.",My hamster engineered a brilliant way out of his cage; afterward I would spend a good part of his life testing his intelligence.

She spent an obscene amount of money on the food for her ""simple"" reception.  Instead of the usual pre-made heat and eat finger foods she had each one special made by an executive chef.  She could have easily done a sit down dinner for half of what she spent.  We prepared the reception hall and food for 300 people, everything was timed to come out of the kitchen minutes before the wedding ended so it would be at its peak when guests walked down from the church.  The wedding was set for 2:00 so at 2:15 I slipped around there to see what kind of crowd we had and wondered where all the cars were.  I panicked thinking somehow we'd screwed up the time for the wedding,  I walked up to the church, peeked in and realized they were in the middle of the ceremony.  The bride invited 300 people, there were less than 40 there and most of them were family.  The reception was horrible...a giant space with tons of food and we had more tables than people.  The bride was noticeably embarrassed.  The wedding planner made everyone crowd around four tables in one corner and literally coached people into posing so they could take pictures that didn't look like the place was empty.

This girl (who will hereafter be referred to as Angie) was currently in a serious relationship with one of Harold's friends. She was shit-faced, Harold was buzzed, and the boyfriend was passed out.

I decided to get over her, I'd go out to a party with a bunch of friends and forget about her. Wrong choice). And she was there because she was the quiet girl who found comfort in walking dogs and talking to them when she had no one else to go to. The first time I saw her all I thought was ""Hey, she's cute"" and kept walking. But a week or so later, we took two dogs who were best friends with each other.. She took one first, and i took the other one a little bit later. We crossed paths with each other twoards the end of the walking path, and my dog started freaking out and jumped on hers and they started playing.

AskReddit,cj7o5bs,"I'm no expert, but I have waxed my pubes since I was sixteen. After forking over lots of money to the salon, I decided I would try doing it myself. At home. 
 So I was super excited when I saw a commercial for [this]( and I went out and bought some. The idea, in my mind, was that I'd be able to smooth the wax onto my vag, grab the edge of the hardened wax and rip it off. I figured I could wax my entire girl region in around ten strips. 
 My first mistake was not adequately trimming my pubes. I'd say they were about 5/8 of an inch long, so not full length but definitely not short enough for this type of waxing. 
 My second mistake, and what lead to my disaster, was smoothing a layer of wax right in the centre of my pubic triangle and making it too thin to grab. It hardened to my hair and skin and I physically couldn't grab at an edge and rip the wax strip off. Like, I was scraping and my skin trying to lift some wax. It wasn't happening. 
 So I decided to apply more wax on top of this strip and form a sort of lift at the edge so the two layers would rip off together. That didn't work. Eventually I ended up with a 1/4"" thick layer of wax on top of my pubic bone, right where the landing strip would be, that I couldn't get off. I used some serums and potions and eventually got the wax to unstick from my skin, but it was still tightly holding onto my hair down there. I COULD NOT REMOVE IT. 
 See, I'd done such a good job at getting that wax right at the base of the hair that I had lost the option to just cut the chunk of dry wax out. So I waited a week and a half for my hair to grow until I could feasibly trim my pubes and get the wax out of my vaginal area.","At 17 years old, I had to walk around for a week and a half with a chunk of dry wax on the front of my lady parts."
AskReddit,ce6dzs0,"I used to think this way as well until I started dating my current SO who did her undergrad thesis on structural racism in America and it is surprisingly still a huge issue for black communities. 
 It's hard to break down, but it goes something along the lines of this (to use an employment example): a manager has two resumes in front of him. They both have exactly the same credentials and work experience and skills required for the job, however one applicant is named Jake Richards and another is Tyrone Moore. 
 Statistically (and this is a studied phenomenon) Jake will be picked for the job almost every single time. Whether it is intended or not, the manager is more comfortable with a ""white"" sounding name. 
 This occurs with all ethnic names. I'm sure you can imagine someone named Muhammad these days having trouble getting employed. 
 Take this to the education level where things are a lot more complicated, but the same base lines still hold true. For example a ""whiter"" sounding name will more likely be approved for bank and student loans. 
 Additionally those who  have  money invariably received better education through the public school system and are likely to go on to get more educated. For example, the public school receives most of it's funding through the local districts property taxes (which reflect property value) school districts are also  specifically  drawn so they encompass rich and poor areas unequally. So one school literally gets all the the funding while another gets next to nothing. 
 Since poor urban communities tend towards ethnic they are stuck in a cycle of poor education, poor employment and poor job opportunities that perpetuate from themselves down to their children and whether you want to believe it or not although slavery was ended a very long time ago and equal rights under law is recognized those eras still to this day affect black communities economically and socially.

Which was fine, I knew she'd miss me and I would seriously miss her too, so we would spend a lot of time together. However I didn't notice everything she was doing at that time, I was kind of blinded by love I guess. So fast forward a month or two, we find out we're pregnant. I'm okay with it, but was a little confused considering she was on birth control.(which I'll explain later). My son was born 2 weeks before I left for Iraq, the second time. During my deployment I would notice some odd behavior from her, but never really stopped and thought about it. Huge mistake on my part but that's life I guess. 
 So I get home fro, Iraq finally and apparently she was off her A-game from me not being around. I found out she was cheating on me while I was gone with a guy she worked with. Once you find out something like that, you know you need to dig even more b/c you need to know every possible thing like it'd make you feel better or something.

 I left the day after Christmas. I let her and my son stay in the house while I figured something else out. Fast forward a little I went and set up CS to pay for my kids needs, while I was cutting his mother off financially.

 As we got to know each other more we fell for each other more and more. I'd fallen in love with him and he'd fallen in love with me, 'real' and 'fake' me. I didn't know what to do. By now I knew that I had to come clean about it all, but then he would ask if I've always been truthful with him, knowing he has trust issues I couldn't tell him that I'd lied to him for so long (I know, worst thing to do) So I said of course I had. 
 Somehow I manage to keep this up, my family and friends somehow never gave anything away even though they didn't know what was going on. 
 All along I knew that I had to tell him the truth, that we couldn't keep it up like this forever. Each time I put a date to when I would come clean something would happen. I know that I want to spend my life with him. But I can't. 
 I know I have to tell him the truth, and soon before it all falls down around me, or I crumble inside all the pressure of it all. 
I know he loves me, but i know once I tell him he wont be able to look at me the same again, I know he wont be able to love me anymore and I know it will be over between us. 
 I know telling him will break his heart as well as mine, but I also know I brought it upon myself. I'm so sorry that I've done this to him. I know he will hate me for it and I know he has every right to hate  me too. 
 The plan is to tell him by the end of the month, only giving myself a few more days to man up and do it.

AskReddit,c53qgpm,"There is a subway across the street from my house. Everyone who works there is awesome except this one dude. He's this tatted up gangster looking fellow (including those tear drop tattoos) who is constantly surly and the worst part: he just throws your sandwich together like he's pulverising meat or something. 
 He always greets you with ""what do you want?"" I've tried to be nice and throw out a ""how's the day goin'?"" that kind of thing, and he will either 
 A: answer with a grunt, or 
 B: ignore you completely. 
 Anyway, the last straw broke when me and a friend of mine went in there the other night. We walk in, he lets out this exaggerated sigh at the idea of having to make a sandwich, then throws my slipshod meatball sub together. My friend asks a question about their gluten free sandwiches and he said ""can't you see the picture?"" 
 I asked him what his problem was and he said ""what? you asked me a question and I answered it."" Tf?! She called him a prick and we left and got food at a supermarket next door. 
 The next day I wrote a complaint on Subways website. I explained previous incidents, the primary incident in question, everything in detail. I also mentioned how every experience I've had with other employees has been great, best subway I've ever been to, which is all true. It ended up being about a page long. I got a call from the owner in the same day apologizing profusely, saying he knew exactly who I was talking about and he would have a talk with him, if anything happened again let him know and the individual in question would not be working for him anymore. 
 Cut to that evening, I was going to the supermarket by the Subway. It was about closing time at Subway. I glance over and realize the disgruntled employee is just standing there with his face practically pressed against the glass, staring directly at me as I was walking by. His eyes looked like they were trying to make me explode. This guy knows where I live. I'm slightly worried he's just gonna stab me next time I go in for a sandwich. I'm kinda feeling like Subway tonight though, so I'll find out.","A disgruntled ex con Subway employee is going to murder me.

AskReddit,c39ijqx,"If you're trying out then first and foremost, have fun and good luck! Your fitness should already be great so I wouldn't worry about that, and you can probably already pass and shoot without a problem. If you can't tackle, learn to block tackle first. My first advice is do not slide tackle unless you know  EXACTLY  what you are doing. When you slide in, three things can happen: 
 1 You miss the ball, get the player. Minimum yellow card, possible red 
 2 You miss the ball and the player. Now you are on the floor, where you are no use and the opponent is 10 yards down the pitch; you have lost him, and if you're a defender then he is one on one with the keeper. 
 3 You get the ball. Well done, but you have no real control over where it is going and now you are on the floor, where you are no use 
 So stay on your feet for the time being! 
 As you get better, ask yourself: do you know what to do without the ball? Watch football on the TV and learn to read a few moves ahead so you know what will happen in 10-20 seconds time. Then when you get on the pitch concentrate on where you are on the pitch, where your teammates are, where the opposition is. It sounds like a lot to bear in mind but 99% of the time you won't have the ball so use it well.","Don't slide tackle  yet , read the game, enjoy yourself, good luck"

AskReddit,cfs2dh8,"I was driving on the interstate at 2 AM in the morning, coming back from a fun weekend with friends, when my stomach starts to feel bad... real bad. 
 I'm in a rural part of Georgia and there is nowhere to stop. I'm starting to sweat profusely and am desperate for a place when I see a highway rest area. Easing into the dark, empty parking lot, I clench and fast walk it into the dimly lit men's room. 
 I just made it... violent flu symptoms rack my GI tract and I knew I would not be going anywhere for a while. That's when I first heard the slow shuffling of feet and an angry muttering voice making their way into the restroom. The one dim, bussing florescent bulb provided a sickly light while the dirty concrete walls ricocheted sound and bent it around me. The result was an environment where sound came from everywhere and objects did not cast shadows but became shadows themselves. 
 The stall door lock had gone missing long ago, so I leaned forward bracing my left hand against the stall door. Still sitting, while my right hand quietly opened a small pocket knife and held it inches from my sweating face. 
 The shuffling of feet and angry muttering stopped at my stall door and pushed. Every nerve in my body was sick, feverish and fearful. I could see dirty shoes topped with rags underneath my door. Rags encrusted with the filth that can only come from living in your clothes for years. ""I'm in here."" My ragged voice reverberated off of the cold concrete walls. He pushed harder next time. 
 I'm pouring sweat, my pants are around my ankles and I'm violently ill. I'm trapped on a toilet with a knife in my hand and a muttering mad hobo trying to enter the stall... then it got strange. 
 He stops pushing the stall door and enters the stall directly next to mine. I hear rustling, angry muttering, and then grunting. 5 minutes? 8 minutes? I don't know, because time stretched out and seemed eternal as I listened to what I can only describe as the sounds of a violent, very mentally ill man, masturbating in the stall next to me. 
 I was frozen in time and fear, bracing the door, watching the indistinct shadows under the stall wall for threats, while still racked with sharp painful contractions in my GI tract. I'm listening to the muttering, grunting and rhythmic sound of fabric moving while imagining having to fight for my life. 
 Time goes by... 
 He ""finished"" and I listened as he shuffled out of the bathroom. I'm still painfully ill for another 10 minutes. My every nerve was on edge as my ears strained, worried, listening for his shuffling footsteps to return. 
 Finally, I think I can get up and make my way through the dark parking lot to my car. I compose myself, open the stall door to leave, and see him standing silently next to the sink... staring at me. 
 My hand is still clenched in a fist with a blade sticking out of it as I lower my head and stare back at him. I have to maneuver within 3 feet him to exit and moved slowly past him not taking my eyes off of him. Out in the dark parking lot I break into a jog to the car and tear out of there, happy feel the cool night air.",I didn't wash my hands one morning in a rest area.
AskReddit,cc0euqu,"I worked at a shop where a younger kid I know from high school would come in every day and hit on me. I would always politely decline any advances. It got to the point where he would start making incredibly rude sexual remarks to me and basically sexually harassing me. Somehow, he got my phone number and began calling and texting me all the time. At this point, I was pissed and continuously told him absolutely never ever leave me the fuck alone. 
 Well, I found out he sold weed and came up with a plan to get this fucker to stop bothering me. After one particularly gross set of texts, I agreed to meet him. I call my buddy who was a pretty whacked out coke head and told him to hide in the back seat of my car and we drove to the meeting place.

I calmly explain the only reason I'm meeting him in person is to once and for all make him realize that's he's a scummy asshole and to stop bothering me.

AskReddit,cef8bie,"I'll toss this one in. I finally stopped lurking so I might as well contribute. 
 Back when I was younger I was in and out of the hospital every so often. I had pretty bad Asthma when I was a kid and once or twice came close to actually dying as my throat almost completely sealed.
My years from 4-9 simply weren't good to me. 
 On a very particular night something...strange happened. 
 It was towards the end of a longer than usual hospital stay. Maybe my 4th day out and I was moved into the room where the kids are put for recovery. 
 It had to of been at least past midnight since this was when my mom had to go back home and watch my older brother. She stayed with me almost every time but she couldn't do it that evening since there was no one at the house. Dad unfortunately had to work that night and considering I was in a hospital she assumed I would be safe. 
 While I was deep asleep I was suddenly woken up with a hand over my mouth. 
 There were 3 of them. Each of them were wearing those white face masks they give out in the infirmary along with hospital scrubs. The one who had their hand over my mouth kept whispering ""be quiet"" and to ""keep it down, it's okay."" while the other two were holding onto my arms/legs to prevent squirming. 
 Obviously I started to freak out but eventually gave in and relaxed myself. I was young and just thought it was routine or normal for such a thing to happen. 
 Once they realized I was quiet the one on the right of the bed pulled out a syringe and raised up my arm. They told me to make a fist and and flex it while they felt up and down looking for a vein. I made the tightest fist that a 6 year old could do as he examined my arm. 
 I remember hearing him say to the others ""Found it"" and then he looked at me dead in the eye and said ""this won't hurt a bit"" as he punctured my skin. 
 Feeling the needle going in was excruciating. Admittedly it was probably compounded with the sheer terror of everything but boy did that sure hurt.
After this I passed out. 
 I told my mom about it when she came back the next day but she said it was probably just a dream and to not worry. How she wasn't made aware of any scheduled visits by staff and told me that it was just my mind playing games with me... 
 I started to eventually believe the same thing. For years now I think back to it and wonder if it actually happened. 
 The thing is...how would a 6 year old know that you need to make a fist and flex when receiving a needle?",An extra long hospital stay ended with me getting woken up by 3 strangers and injected with something I don't know.

AskReddit,copul0s,"My 10th grade Chemistry teacher actually did have it out for me.  I was so horrible at the subject.  I would stay after school a few times a week and ask him to tutor me (like walk me through a few problems then I'd try myself) and he would just leave the room without showing me how to do anything.  He would hate when I asked questions in class because it took up learning time....  One time we had finished the classwork and he said we could just wait the last 10 minutes until the bell rang, so I pulled out my Alg2/trig homework to work on that was due the next day, and I asked a student for help since she was in a higher math class.  She was helping me out and I started to figure it out on my own... Then my teacher came and ripped it up saying I shouldn't be doing other teachers' homework in his class.  Oh man, I flipped shit on him.  From then on I would just sleep through his classes and ignore him and tell him off, while I did EVERY question in the textbook at home.  I had to teach myself chemistry.  One time he woke me up with a question (sort of a ""fuck you for sleeping in my class"") to which I answered correctly.  He looked dumbfounded that I woke up with the right answer so quickly.  I told him to get bent and not to disturb my sleep anymore. 
 Anyway, I started getting B's+ on tests and quizes.  At the end of the year I got the second highest grade in the class on the statewide standardized test and he accused me of cheating and said I didn't deserve that grade.  I told him he didn't deserve to teach if he wasn't willing to help me and if he was gonna accuse someone of cheating. 
 Looking back, yeah I was disrespectful and shouldn't have cussed at him so much, especially in class..  but god damn, I fucking hate that man.  Also, he made me sit in the back by myself and wouldn't allow me a lab partner.

AskReddit,c9uc569,"The Hunger Games 
 I know its a trilogy, and I have not read the books so I don't know the actual ending. I am taking just the first one as a stand alone story. 
 I think they really missed a great opportunity to explore the whole death of innocence theme. Although it is supposed to be a young adult book, so obviously not too heavy stuff, but for a book about a bunch of kids killing each other it was very tame. 
 I really wanted to see Katniss actually have to grasp the concept that she has to kill another human being. She never really does this. The deaths she causes are either an automatic survival reaction, or something else actually commits the final act. I really wanted to see her have to look someone in the eye as she takes their life. She never seemed to deliberately kill any of the others. 
 Ok anyways the ending I think would have made it so much better. It is her and the little black girl left since Katniss takes her under her wing and protects her through the whole ordeal. Unlike the original, they are not both allowed to live. So in a tear jerking moment of clarity, Katniss kills herself to save the the little girl.

AskReddit,c8392r5,"I think a lot of how a social networking site is used is determined by the people who use them. 
 It's true that a lot of people use Twitter & Facebook as soapboxes to vent, be negative, whine, be passive aggressive etc, which can be observed in any medium, IMO. This has been happening since the days of LiveJournal, MySpace & Hi5. 
 On the other hand, I've seen people use social networking sites to do some incredibly amazing things. I wrote a paper on this recently and it's amazing how many counties have successfully used social networking sites to help in the event of a natural disaster. Off the top of my head: 
 a. Thailand used FB during a flooding crisis and helped citizens take care of animals & shared resources 
 b. The Queensland Police Department established an official social media presence ahead of time and did phenomenal work when floods hit. They constantly updated Twitter & FB with news from other departments, shot down rumours & continually provided crucial information. 
 c. An immense amount of money was raised on a LiveJournal community called help_japan when the Tsunami of 2011 hit & also after the earthquake (?) in Haiti. Additionally, since Japan experienced erratic power cuts post-Tsunami) a Twitter account (I think it was @earthquake_jp?) kept the general public updated about which regions would experience power shutdowns at what times etc.

My grandmother came over for the first few years to take care of me while my mother worked all these different jobs. When I was about three we had a woman named Andrea living in our house with us. She was a really mean broad with an alcohol problem. Not to mention that she had a vicious chihuahua that ate furniture, the dog actually bit me in the face when I was really young and I have a small scar on my cheek because of it. 
 One night, Andrea got really mad because she wanted to make a long distance call on the home phone, but wouldn't pay and expected my mother to.

It may LOOK easy to bust down a door,  toss a flashbang, sweep a room, and then put four rounds into a target with a one inch spread, but there's alot of complexity in the details.

AskReddit,cb2p1su,"An old friend of mine back from my hometown lied to his wife about being in the military. 
 Now, he did sign up for the army, but before he signed his last waiver (or whatever it is, I don't know much about this stuff) he opted not to go. We ended up getting shit faced with all of our friends for a week to dodge the recruiter. 
 A few years later we were all hanging out at his apartment with his gf (now wife) and the topic came up. She heard mentioned something about her ""military man"". We all laughed because we seriously though she was joking but when she got mad at us we knew something was up. She then went on to say just because he was injured in basic training and discharged does not degrade his service to our country. Which at that point we laughed harder because we all knew he never went! He took us aside later that evening and basically told us that he lied to her to get something (sympathy, pussy, some not important shit) and asked if we wouldn't bring it up again. I was crashing on his couch at this point because I was out of a job and didn't have a place to stay. I agreed to keep his dirt. 
 Later, when they got married her family wrote a something about Kelly marrying a service man in the wedding program. The lie was obviously bigger than what we had thought. None of us wanted to be the source off drama at the wedding so we didn't say anything. 
 Now fast forward a few years. They have three kids together and she find out that I am now a mortgage loan officer. She ends up emailing me asking how to get a va loan. I didn't actually tell her the truth, but I couldn't exactly lie (since steering people away from applying for a loan is very unethical) I told her the documents she needed hoping she goes to dig for them herself and put two and two together. I hate myself for not saying anything to her years ago. Lying about being in the military is one of the most awful things you could do in my opinion. I just hope I have her nudged her enough she can find our on her own.","friend lets me crash at his place while homeless, find out he lied to his wife about being in the military, kept his secret even when asked by his wife."

 I had a former employer who had written my employment contract without legal counsel (or, more likely, downloaded it off the internet).  I did some reasearch after I quit and a few of his clauses would prevent me from working in my field, which is against the law in Canada.  I was fairly sure I was right (I found legal cases of similar circumstances in my province, saw those judgements and the reasons for them) but I wanted an expert's advice. 
 I asked a friend of mine (who owns her own business) for the name of her business lawyer - she referred me, and her lawyer called me himself, asked me to email over the contract and a brief overview of the situation so he could read it over and do some digging.  He met with me later that week, explained what the contract covered and what it didn't, the best way to avoid ending up in court (my former boss would lose, but it would be a big pain and waste of time), and things to look for in future legal contracts.  Our phone conversation took twenty minutes, our meeting was about an hour, and he didn't charge me a dime.  He said if my boss ever tried to enforce the contract, I could come back and we'd have to work out a payment system then, but he was happy to give me a bit of advice and allay my fears.","Had a legal problem, called a lawyer, he figured it out in like an hour, gave me solid advice, didn't charge me anything.

AskReddit,cgry5nm,"Oh god, this might be ridiculously long, but I'll see. 
 way back in 10th grade, i met this girl. She was a grade below me,  but not much younger. We'd hang out after school regularly for theater rehearsals. We talked and got to know each other, and i started to have a crush on her. Of course, 16 year old me was an awkward, clueless coward, so I never did anything. We were both on the track-field team, and had a similar group of friends. Eventually, she started dating one of my best friends, but that didn't last the rest of the school year. That summer we hung out more often. We were both in marching band (the best summer activity ever.) 
 Cue the next school year. Still just friends, but talking a lot. Typical awkward stuff. Finally, after much berating from my friends, I finally build up the courage to ask her out on a date. I planned to do it at the end of the week, and ask her out to do something over the weekend. The Tuesday before was one of my worst high school experiences. 
 That morning I'm hanging out with my friends before school starts. We're just chilling, when a girl from the grad above us comes in to talk to one of my friends. They talk, and this girl mentions that her younger brother just started dating some girl. A little further prodding, and it turns out to be the girl I was planning on asking out. My friends give me looks of pity and sadness. I just sat there for a bit, my young heart and soul crushed, the puppy love I had maintained withering away. 
 So my crush and this guy start dating, and about half way through the school year I do something incredibly stupid. I confess that I liked her (as in ""like-liked"" her) and we talk. Turns out she probably wouldn't have said yes even if I had asked. Talk about kicking a guy while he's down, that crushed me. Junior year of high school was actually hell. 
 So, make it through the summer, going into senior year, and I've finally managed to move on. She's still dating the same guy, and I have a different girl who I was planning on asking out. We get about halfway through the year, and I learn that my original crush and her boyfriend are having issues, partly related to how good of friend my crush and I are. He was getting jealous of me, apparently, and didn't trust her completely. I'd never done anything but be nice, so I just laughed it off. Then I once again do something terribly stupid. 
 One day after school, they had a bigger fight than usual. She finds me, and we sit and talk for about three hours straight. My feelings for her are brought up, and she admits that she likes me, and did the year before as well.  Now, the timing of this was absolute shit, as just two weeks before I had started dating a different girl. So I was between a rock and a hard place, as was she. After another month of talking, and some more intimate things together, she officially broke up with her boyfriend. She reassured me that the relationship was going bad anyways, and that I wasn't to blame, but I still feel bad since I had a notable influence on the matter. 
 I have a choice now; dump one girl for the other, or stick with what I have. I'm an incredibly indecisive person, and this was a really sucky decision. Either I admit that I don't feel the same about my crush (which would be a lie), or dump my girlfriend and ruin an amazing friendship (also awful). Ultimately, I did the latter, and I consider it one of my bigger mistakes of high school. It wasn't a bad breakup, but it wasn't fun, either. 
 We didn't start dating until after graduation, and we date all summer. It starts out fine, but things turn sour really quick. The attraction between us just wasn't the same as it had been, and we grew apart. Less than a month into college I break up with her, which wasn't easy in the slightest. I simply didn't feel the same way about her, and I didn't want to lie to her about something like that. 
 Things are better now, and we still talk from time to time. She's moved on, as have I.","Liked a girl for 3 years in high school, missed first two chances, hit the third but it didn't work out."

AskReddit,cnb49od,"Being a stupid teenager. 
 This happened 3 years ago. 
 Preface: I have always enjoyed riding dirt bikes.  And a few years ago I decided I wanted a bike I could ride to work.  So I start researching motorcycles, checking around my area for ones in my price range.  Finally find one, and I text the guy and I set a time to meet him the next day. 
 Well, strange thing happened that night.  We got the biggest rain storm of my life.  Washed out roads, shut down businesses, and standing water on 40ish% of the roads surrounding the area.  And I'm like ""hur-dur I'm going to go buy this bike anyway because I'm smart.""  So I proceed to drive to where I meet him and test drive and agree on a price.  Hey, I'm the proud new owner of a crotch rocket, awesome!  So I start driving home, road I came in on that was about 6 inches underwater is now about 10 inches underwater.  So that's not gonna fly.  So I spend about 45 minutes finding an alternate route.  Which finally comes to fruition and I make my way back to my house.  I show off to my roommates and then head up to my parents house to show my dad (big fan of motorcycles, figured he'd enjoy my rocket.) 
 On my way up to my dad's, I'm going 10-15 mph over the speed limit.  Noticing how crazy that acceleration response is, even in high gear makes me like a giddy little kid.  So I'm going 80ish already in 5th gear.  And I decide, I wanna see how easy I can get to 100.  Spin the throttle, make it to 100 with ease.  Well, this gets my mind going, hmm, I wonder how much faster I can go.  So once I get to the next stop sign and get going again, I hit it.  We're talking like 0-120 mph in a few seconds.  It was amazing.  But I keep climbing, I love the adrenaline and want to see what this baby can do.  So I'm climbing; 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, and I break 150 and think ""holy shit! This. IS. AWESOME"".  I saw my speedo hit 156 and I backed off because I could tell it was giving her all it had, and because I see a mirage a ways up the road and it kinda scared me.  Well I'm cruising up to this ""mirage"" friggin' fast because ya know, 140ish mph (after letting go of the throttle.)  And I come to the realization, holy crap it's actually water, not a mirage. 
 I start hitting my back brake and grabbing my front brake.  I was down to about 110-115ish mph.  There was a 0% chance I was slowing down enough to stop before it.  So I fucking peg my throttle and hope for the best.  Right as I'm about to hit the water, I let go of the throttle and just grab onto the grips for dear life.  When I hit it, I could feel my back tire starting to waver, and at that point I had shut my eyes.  I had tensed up so much, trying to keep the handlebars as straight as possible, and gripping the gas tank with my thighs that I thought I was going to pass out.  The second I hit that dry pavement and felt my back tire grab hold of it, I opened my eyes and started hitting my brakes again.  I dropped down to the speed limit, opened my visor, and screamed a victory scream of relief. 
 The whole hydroplane part happened in a window of like 5 seconds.  It went from ""mirage"", to ""oh shit"", to ""oh shit shitfuckballs"", to ""I'm dead, I've accepted this"", to screaming like a little girl that I was alive and on pavement (still on my bike) all within that 5 seconds.  And ever since, I've barely gone 5 mph over the speed limit.","stupid 19y/o male buys crotch rocket, likes speed, hits 150 mph, hydroplanes, screams like a little girl after not dying.

AskReddit,c3mq6ho,"I'm gonna answer backwards--last question first. I did go to Lijiang. It's fun in a giant, fake-ish old town way. Early early morning is the best time to be out and about--midday, any time of the year, it is usually shoulder to shoulder! The real old town was destroyed by an earthquake. But the rebuilt one is beautiful, and if you get out of the town into the hills (or tiger leaping gorge) it's worth it. Mama Naxi's hostel in Lijiang is fun and crazy (she had upwards of 15 cats, dogs, kittens, and puppies living in the common area). Mama Naxi is a great hostess--she really treats you well, and the in-house restaurant is great! 
 I was never scared of legal trouble involving hash. The cops in Dali do know what it is, unlike the cops in most of China, haha, but they're more likely to come down on the dealers than the hapless tourists. 
 Kunming and Dali are rarely humid because of the altitude, but for SE Asia, all I can say is take many showers! Cold ones, which, if you're on a budget, is all you'll get anyway. Talcum powder can help if you're prone to heat rash, and drink more water than you think you need. And don't wear tight clothes! Linen and cotton and loose! 
 Lastly, I can't tell you much about budgeting for Japan since I've only ever been there for a layover, but Yunnan and Guangxi are pretty cheap places. If it's not a Chinese holiday, you can often get hostel beds for as little as 15 to 25 yuan per night (£3 to 5?) if you don't mind dorm beds. Though you may have to pay slightly more than that in Guangxi. Food is another 50-60 yuan (£5 to 7) a day if you stick to cheaper restaurants. A rule of thumb is that if the restaurant has a grubby tile decor, and lots of people waiting for their food, it's gonna be tasty and cheap. Check out what other folks are eating and point to order it if you don't know what it is. Hostel restaurants are overpriced and crappy, but if you can't read Chinese or crave burgers/chips/spaghetti they are certainly convenient.  I guess that's £10-15 a day for room and board if you are willing to be a budget champion. I would recommend finding out the exact prices of each bus/train you are planning to take and then increase the price by 10% to be safe. I was there 2009 and things change so quickly--definitely leave yourself some padding. I found that even the latest travel guide prices were out of date! 
 Prices in Laos (I never made it to Vietnam or Cambodia) are similar or a little cheaper, but they have a hefty visa fee. So does China, for that matter, and I think you have to get it ahead of time unless you go to Hong Kong first. (Maybe that's just because I'm American.... :/ )
Thailand is a little more expensive all around because it's such well-trodden tourist territory. I think our hostel in Bangkok was around £10 per night, and there was no air conditioning! On any of the islands, be prepared for double or triple that, and still no AC! Overnight trains are a great way to save money since you avoid paying for a bed, but bring your own snacks (oh god, and most important: TOILET PAPER). There will always be boiled water available on trains in China.","version: Actually, if you read nothing else I wrote, read this: BRING YOUR OWN TOILET PAPER EVERYWHERE.

I get inside and he says, ""Oh we are going to work on the comp. upstairs."" I tell him what happened to my knee and he asks if i can make it up stairs. I say sure and i hobble up the stairs one at a time putting all of my weight on the wall and sliding up against gravity.

 When I was eight or nine years old, I think, Mariah Carey's music video for ""Always Be My Baby"" gave me my first documented boner.  Now, I use the word ""documented"" because I'm sure I had some before then, but the first humdinger of a yogurt-slinger sweatpants clinger I remember having had was the first time I watched that video. 
 [For the curious, I think it was dat midriff]( which really did me in.  Plus the other ""kids"" who kiss underwater at camp, something which a nerdy, young, jpomnapalm aspired to do. 
 So anyway, my slow uncle Denny walks into my room to discover me laying on my belly in my bedroom, as young bebonered boys are sometimes wont to do, while watching said music video for the millionth time.  Rather than try to explain my misguided lil' kid sexual fantasies to my uncle, who might not truly understand the root of them anyway, I just told him that Mariah Carey was by far my favorite artist. 
 No big deal; situation diverted, uncle left the room, I finished having my boner, and that was that. 
 Fast forward a few months to Christmas or my Birthday, I forget which, my uncle bought me the Mariah Carey CD containing that song, along with a ""signed"" poster of her (had the image of her signature on it).  Okay, whatever, I remembered what I had told him, I just thanked him profusely for the gifts (""What a treasure!"") and went about my life. 
 Fast forward to today.  While I haven't seen him in a couple of years, since then - for every birthday and Christmas, whether we connected or not, he would send me the latest Mariah Carey CD, or when they started existing, DVD's.  Posters up the wazoo came in the mail for every occasion. 
 I had a box filled to the brim with Mariah Carey swag, and by 16 it was humiliating rather than hot, so I stowed them away.  Whenever he would come to visit, I was too heartbroken to tell him that I didn't like Mariah Carey anymore, or that she was never someone I even liked, so I just let him continue, and when I knew his arrival was imminent, I used the one part of my wall not covered in punk posters to decorate with Mariah Carey posters from over the years. 
 I haven't seen my slow uncle Denny in some time now, but there is still a box in my parents' basement filled with all kinds of shit that a real fan would probably appreciate.  Including Glitter.  Yeah.","Didn't want my slow Uncle Denny to know I was hiding a boner while watching a Mariah Carey video, told him I loved her music, 18 years later I have a collector's box filled with her CD's, posters, and junk (Glitter)"
AskReddit,ce2m5x3,"Point mutations. One little fuck up during DNA reproduction- one single nucleotide can change just one single amino acid in a protein, which can cause that protein stop working correctly. So one single nucleotide change can cause disfiguring to deadly genetic diseases. Some examples: [Tay-Sachs disease, Sickle-Cell Anemia, Cystic Fibrosis]( [FOP aka ""Stone Man's Syndrome""]( and [Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease]( On top of that, some of these mutations have dominant effect- it's as if your body says ""Nope, can't remember how to make it correctly,"" because that one nucleotide is incorrect on  one copy of the gene . Replication just seems so fragile when such a small, seemingly insignificant piece of the puzzle can cause death. 
 If you think of all the trillions and trillions of cells that make up you during your entire lifetime, and all the DNA reproduction and the protein synthesis needed to make these cells function correctly, potentially devastating mistakes seem so easy. However, they rarely happen. Your body is so amazing at DNA reproduction that these trillions of cells have built in protection during replication to prevent, identify, and fix copying errors.","I don't know what leaves me in more awe: the fact that a point mutation can cause such amazing changes to the  entire  body, or the fact that the body is able to protect against this on such a mind-blowing scale."
AskReddit,cbgew2w,"Back in high school, junior year I believe. I was throwing a house party and had something like 40-60 people there. I let an old buddy of mine come to the party (who I already wasn't really friends with by that point). 
 The party is in full force and I (stupidly) put the buddy in charge of the bar and drinks, and tell him to not drink too much. Of course he decides to get ridiculously shit-faced. He starts running to one of the bathrooms but he has his hand on the door as he is trying to open it. So like an idiot he keeps pushing the door closed as he's aggressively trying to get into the bathroom. He then proceeds to projectile vomit all over my wall. I'm furious at this point, and I'm like, ""dude, what the hell! Clean this shit up!"" He stumbles and is way to drunk to clean up. Luckily some of my friends offered to clean up the mess. At this point he thinks I'm gonna beat the shit out of him so he runs upstairs. I'm yelling for his name and walking up the stairs, everybody is following me up (they think their about to watch a fight). 
 As I'm halfway up the stairs, my ""buddy"" emerges at the top. He is completely undressed and only in his boxers. Everybody at the party sees this and laughs their asses off. I can't help but laugh too as I tell him to put his clothes back on. He runs into another room and disappears for the rest of the night. 
 The party finally dies down around 3 or 4am, and most people have left by this point. I get into my bed and proceed to go to sleep until I notice something under my bed. It's my buddy, passed the fuck out...under my bed. Whatever I thought to myself....I'm going to sleep. A couple of hours later he runs into my bathroom, and I just shake it off as nothing. I wake up in the morning and notice he is still in the bathroom. I open the door and he is passed out in my shower/tub... I crack up and wake him up. He barely knew anything that happened that night, but I made him clean up my entire house for being such a fuck up. I never invited him to another house party again.","an old friend went to my house party. He got drunk and puked all over my wall.

AskReddit,cbqc4qp,"I guess I didn't technically  see  this but I digress: 
 I went on a trip with my two friends to go South Korea to visit my brother who's currently teaching there (we're American). 
 My brother lives there so he knew his way around and how to be polite. I pretty much followed his lead but my friends acted a little touristy and kind of rude sometimes, esp. Friend #1. Friend #1 kept taking pictures with his iPad (not a cultural misstep, but still really dorky and annoying) and friend #2 couldn't not think about food every five seconds so he was constantly eating food and making a mess and whatever. Friend #1 also has a giant back tattoo and he really wanted to go to a Korean spa and basically he goes in there and there's a sign in the main room that says ""No tattoos allowed in this place"" and he just ignores it. Nobody bothered him about it, though. 
 So my brother takes us to Busan and Friend #2 really wants to check out the local market (foodie). Now my brother's friend from Busan, had told my brother to  not  to go the section of the Busan market that sold dogs for consumption. My brother mentions it casually as a warning and all the sudden Friend #1 and Friend #2 are rearing to go. After a general walk around, F1 and F2 tell us they really want to go to the dog market. I have nothing against eating dog but my family has always had dogs so I feel too emotionally attached to them. We decide to spilt up - my brother and I go to get coffee outside the market and Friend #1 and Friend #2 decide to go check out the dog market. 
 They later told us that they had been chased out by a gang of old ladies. Friend #2 then tells us that he didn't understand why they chased them out because they actually wanted to try the meat. My brother explains that as far as he understands, dog meat is actually now illegal in Korea so the people selling the meat probably didn't want some foreigner seeing what they were doing. 
 Then my brother says: ""It's not like you were taking pictures, right?""
They totally did.",My American friends took pictures in an illegal Korean dog meat market before being chased out by old ladies.

AskReddit,c31ihgg,"There are far worse examples like this! People abducting, abusing and/or killing children sometimes get probation or walk free altogether like Mrs. Anthony.
Sorry I never quoted any actual cases so far, I'm not making stuff up, here's a Ohio site with tons of examples:
[Activist site to block parole alltoghether]( 
 Your example, as well as other cases are perfect prove that ""rehabilitation"" in its current state obviously doesn't work, the parole board is in no way an effective way to determine if the criminal is rehabilitated, yet they are damn expensive. 
 Now what we are looking for is if the death penalty would fix this problem.
(On a sidenote: I will quote a death penalty activist site for the numbers because I personally believe that statistics are in no way facts and as they differ from source to source, so using a statistic that argues against my case to prove my standpoint is not only far more effective but also the only reasonable thing to do. ) 
 [DEATH PENALTY AND SENTENCING INFORMATION]( 
 From from 1973-96 almost 6000 people where sentenced to death but only 358 executed, how come? I mean the judges order was execution, shouldn't it be final? The truth is that it's actually not that hard to evade a death sentence, a good way of avoiding it altogether is showing regret in front of the jury and/or the judge by, let's say, pleading guilty. So how many people who did plead guilty received a capital punishment? According to [DeathPenaltyInfo]( none. 
 I interpret this as pure bullshit, how come someone could just lie in court and evade a death sentence by acting and someone who tells the truth, by declaring innocence, is at greater risk. Who would plead innocent? Well obviously someone who is, but yet it's far better if that person just lies and tells the judge he is guilty. This is no way fair justice but rather prove how lazy our system has become. 
 Next: 6000 sentenced but only 358 executed, how come? Well first there is the governor, those who are sentenced can write and ask the governor of the state for mercy, how many people got out this way? I don't know, it would be silly for the governor to contradict the judge, most of the governors in states, where capital punishment is still in order, have a pretty clear standpoint on the subject. But let's be generous let's say 5% of the criminals are pardoned by the governor, still leaves us with 5265 criminals in the eye of the law who where sentenced but never executed. Well some of them did die in the death cell, before we got the chance to fry them... dammit...
Plus [since 1973, over 130 people have been released from death rows throughout the country due to evidence of their wrongful convictions.](
Still leaves us with about 3000 people who where sentenced to death but never executed. All in all we had a 0.06% success rate for executions compared to murder. When you take the success rate of the death penalty in general of people who where proven to be guilty and executed compare to people who where wrongly executed.
[DeathPenaltyInfo]( you get a much higher number of almost 10%. 
 Just to get this in context: Wrongly executed means ""proven innocent"", this does not involve the cases of people we had doubts about like recently Troy Davis (just use  Google  or many, many others.
So of the 0.06% of people actually executed almost 10% where proven to be innocent plus all the cases of executed people where we never were sure if they should have been executed in the first place leaves us with a success rate of about 0.037% for the death penalty. 
 Could the death penalty work? Absolutely, we could get a 100% success rate, if you murder someone you get killed yourself! That simple! Still leaves us with the question if the punishment should fit the crime though plus and far more important it involves a huge reform on the system itself. Technology is advanced enough to give everybody CCTV implants powered by body heat that would record the crime as it happened, like this we could be sure we have the right guy. Of course this involves everybody, be it president, congressman, citizen or bum. Any other way?","The system doesn't work, if we argue in favor of capital punishment or against it doesn't matter. Numbers say just as much as a big fart, as long as one guy is executed wrongfully we have to consider the fact that the death penalty is wrong, not to mention that it's ineffective."

AskReddit,c5mfcx2,"Commenting here so I remember to tell you a long ass shaggy dog story about a clown. It's far too long to type on my phone. 
 --Edit: The story!  (I'm so sorry for this, btw) 
 So, there's this kid, maybe 7 years old.  We'll call him little Johnny, 'cause all unnamed kids in stories like these are called little Johnny.  He's been obsessed with the circus his entire life. He loves all of it...the little cars, the elephants, the lions, the trapeze and the high wire...but most of all, he loves the clowns.  He begs and begs and begs his parents, and finally they agree to take him. 
 It's opening night, and he's so excited, he's managed to get his parents there an hour before the show even starts.  They get great seats; first row, right in the center.  He's in heaven.  He watches in amazement as the animals parade around - the elephants stomp and stand on two legs, the lions growl and scratch at their trainers.  He gasps with the crowd as one of the high wire walkers nearly falls.  He giggles and squirms in his seat as the clowns come out in their little cars.  Finally, the moment he's been waiting for his entire life! 
 The clowns are great.  They do all the bits he's been wanting to see.  The water in the shirt flowers.  The pratfalls.  The pies to the face.  Everything.  Finally, the main clown takes a microphone and makes an announcement. 
 ""Ladies and Gentlemen, in honor of opening night, I'd like to thank you all for coming.  I'd like to ask for a volunteer from the audience."" 
 Tons of hands shoot into the air, little Johnny's being perhaps the fastest.  The searchlight scans around and around in the stands, and as luck would have it, it falls on little Johnny!  The clown walks over to him slowly, a huge smile on his face. 
""Hey kid, what's your name?"" 
""Johnny!"" 
""Is this your first time to the circus?"" 
""Yep, sure is!"" 
""Well, I'm so glad you came!  I just have a couple questions for you.  Are you the head of horse?"" 
""No..."" 
""Oh!  Well, then are you the ears of a horse?"" 
""No..."" 
""Oh my!  Well then, might you maybe be the LEGS of a horse?"" 
""No..."" 
""Well then...that must mean...you're the horses ASS!"" 
 And the entire audience roars with laughter!  Little Johnny is crushed.  He sinks lower and lower in his seat, fighting back the tears.  When he gets home that night, the rips all his circus posters off the walls, throws all his clown toys in the trash, and cries himself to sleep. 
 Fast forward a few years; and little Johnny is now ""John"".  He's working his way through college, and the circus comes to town.  He couldn't give it any less thought, but his girlfriend is begging him to go.  Finally, he relents, and goes with her to opening night. 
 It's nearly exactly as he remembers it to be.  The animal acts first, then the acrobatics, and finally the clowns.  The audience laughs, but John sits in his seat, stoic and still.  Finally, the house lights drop and the spotlight begins to spin.  John sits up as he realized the lead clown is the same man from all those years before!  As he asks for a volunteer, John's throat begins to close tightly.  By the devils own hand perhaps, the spotlight once again falls on Johnny.  His girlfriend is ecstatic, but Johnny is as white as a sheet fresh from the wash and hanging on a line in the southern sunshine.  The clown grins as he walks over, not quite yet recognizing Johnny.  As he approaches, he nearly falls over laughing when he makes the connection.  Taking the microphone, he begins: 
""Hey sir, what's your name?"" 
""John."" 
""Is this your first time to the circus?"" 
""No."" 
""I thought I recognized you!  I just have a couple questions for you.  Are you the head of horse?"" 
""No."" 
""Oh!  Well, then are you the ears of a horse?"" 
""No."" 
""Oh my!  Well then, might you maybe be the LEGS of a horse?"" 
""No."" 
""Well then...that must mean...you're the horses ASS!"" 
 And of course, Johnny is mortified.  The entire audience explodes in fits of laughter, but Johnny storms out.  That night, Johnny begins drinking heavily, and in a fit of bourbon strikes his girlfriend.  A few months later, Johnny has dropped out of college, distraught over the split from his sweetheart and mortified at the thought of his entire town being witness to his shame. 
 Fast forward once again a few years.  Johnny is nothing more then a common bum now.  He begs on the street corners for change, and spends every dime he gets on his next bottle.  He eats in the soup kitchen when he can remember where it is, and showers only when he's lucky enough to get some rain.  He has two best friends - if you can call them that really - who are the only people alive in the world who know his story.  They know Johnny is a smart man, if he could just get over his past he could really make something of himself.  They hatch a plan to send him to the circus once more, to try and get him over his fears and move on with his life. 
 Being bums themselves though, they can't find a way to come up with the money to get him a ticket.  Finally, they decide they're going to sneak him in.  They beg and plead with him, but he's stubborn and absolutely refuses to go, eventually letting it slip that what he's terrified of most is being put into that spotlight again.  He says he just doesn't know what to do!  One of his friends, slick Joe, tells him not to worry.  He'll be right there with him, and if by some twist of fate it happens again, slick Joe will have a comeback ready for him.  Johnny knows Joe is always been a fast talker, and finally agrees, so long as they'll give him a bottle before.  And another, for while he's there.    Under the cover of darkness Joe and Johnny slip under the back of the tent and climb up the back of the bleachers.  Sitting in the top row, they can't see nearly as well, but everything looks the same to Johnny. First the animals, the lions and the giraffes and the elephants.  Next, the acrobatics come out.  The high-wire is dramatic.  The trapeze is fantastic.  And finally, out come the clowns.  Johnny shrinks in his seat as they pratfall and dance and throw pies around.  Then, his stomach turns and he nearly runs out as the house lights dim.  He looks carefully, and gasps!  The head clown, now clearly and old man, is the vary same man once again!  He's looking for an audience member to humiliate, and somehow his ancient eyes fall on Johnny. 
 His grin becomes cruel and cold and he points him out, and begins to climb the stairs. 
 ""Hey there.  Long time no see.  Tell the audience your name."" 
In a tiny voice: ""Johnny"" 
""How many times have you come to see me now?"" 
""Three..."" 
""Well, I'm so glad you came!  I just have a couple questions for you.  Are you the head of horse?"" 
""No."" 
""Oh!  Well, then are you the ears of a horse?"" 
""No."" 
""Oh my!  Well then, might you maybe be the LEGS of a horse?"" 
""No."" 
""Well then...that must mean...you're the horses ASS!"" 
 Johnny looks like he's going to die.  His face has lost all color.  His hands and feet are shaking, and his eyes are swimming in tears.  He's nearly laying in his seat, and with all hope lost, he looks up at Slick Joe.  Slick Joe is his friend, and he's not going to let Johnny down. 
 Joe stands up. 
 He looks right at the clown. 
 He points his finger and says: 
 ""Hey!  Fuck you, clown"".

 Female friend wants to hook me up with her friend. See her and she is hot. I flirt with her seems to be going well not trying to hard all good. 
 We start to text a few times a day. She replys its great. 
 I ask her out but she always has an excuse. I'm starting to get the hint she doesn't like me. 
 My female friend who introduced us said this girl is actually interested in me and not to give up. I bring her flowers at work and she is very happy making eye contact smiling whole 9 yards...........so lets go out..............nope busy. 
 I see her at a party and after 2 minutes of talking she gets up and walks away. Kind of avoids me rest of the night. 
 Finally I text her the next day......she never replys. 
 OK she has made it clear not interested in me. I take a hint and stop.

AskReddit,c915oj3,"I'm in the car business and have consulted with dealers for years after spending a lot of time in the retail side of things.  A few years back, my girlfriend at the time wanted a new car, so I took her shopping.  Did all the research, knew exactly what numbers a fair deal should be, etc.  She wanted a specific color and options, and only two dealers around had that car.  One of them was exceptional, but the car wasn't going to be in stock for another 10 days, whereas one dealer had the car currently in stock (this is within a 50 mile radius btw). Problem was, she wanted to lease, and lease programs expire monthly, so we didn't know if the same program would carry over the next month, and if it didn't her payment would go up, so we wanted to get the car now. 
 It's the last day of the month, and we go to the dealer with the car in stock around 7pm.  I'm in jeans, a t-shirt, and leather harley jacket (It's the end of January).  I don't disclose I'm in the business, and politely deal with the salesman, and every 'trick' they have, I'm a step ahead of them.  I offer them a fair deal they should have taken, with profit, and when he presented it to the manager, he threw the paper up in the air and said 'I don't have fucking time for this, throw them out'.  Salesman comes over hanging his head, and says 'my manager said no, our deal is the best deal (which was absurd), thanks for stopping in.'  Thanked him for his time, and left. 
 The next day, I had to meet with a dealer very close to this one, and before that meeting, I stop in this dealership, but this time, I'm in a suit and tie.  As soon as I walk in, same manager greets me with 'Good morning sir, how can I help you?' I say to him 'Hi Charles, my name is i_use_this_for_work, I was here last night trying to buy that 6 (Mazda 6; pointed to it as it was in the showroom), but you 'didn't have fucking time' for my offer, guess you hit your number, huh?'  He turns white, realizing I was there last night dressed differently, and starts backpedaling, saying 'oh, well it was late, and leases are very complicated [they're not!!], and yes, we did hit our goal so we weren't begging for car deals.'  I tell him that I don't have the time to sit here with him, as I'm meeting Mr. XXXX (owner of dealer down the street, who he knows), so call me with a yes or no to my offer. 
 Calls me later that day, tells me yes, he'll accept my offer.  Seeing as it was the new month, programs stayed the same, so we wait for the car to come in at the other dealer five days later.  Not only was their service awesome, but knowing I had a deal locked up in one place, I asked for a few hundred more of a discount, and they obliged. 
 In the ensuing three years, I helped two other friends buy new Mazdas from that same dealer, all had stellar experiences.  Oh, and I've since received that manager's resume for a job; he didn't get hired.","Douchebag car dealer sales manager profiles me in harley jacket and jeans, tries to save face when I'm in a suit the next day, costs his dealership three new car sales and at least $5k in profit (which is at least $1k to his salesman and probably $500+ to him)."

For a 7 year old, that in itself was traumatic.  The school day went well, it wasn't till the ride home I made my first friend there though. 
 On the bus people sat front to back from lowest grade to highest grade, I decided to sit in the back with the big kids.  Not wanting to let some snot nosed 2nd grader ruin their image, they relegated me to the 2nd grade area.  Trying to make friends there I was sitting legs into the isle, talking to people.  Then the bus hits a huge bump and throws us all in the air.  The kid across from me ended up kicking me in the knee.  I took offense to that.  Once everything settled down, I punched him.  Square in the nose.  Broke it too.  There was blood everywhere.   This kid got dropped off at his house, and when we got to mine the bus driver told my mom what happened and the address of the kid.  She drove me to his house and made me go apologize.  That was one of the scariest things I've done, even now.  I ended up saying sorry, and the kid became one of my best friends.

 One day he asks my buddy if he'd like to see something. He takes him off to a side room that had some storage boxes in it, but was mostly empty except a chair in the middle. He reaches under the chair and pulls out a crusty booger and eats it right in front of him. Apparently there were HUNDREDS of aged boogers that this kid just wiped under the seat and then eats later. 
 Not sure what compelled him to think that was a good idea, but he went for it. Needless to say my friend stopped going over there and the smelly kid stayed smelly.","Knew a kid that had a ""booger chair"" in its own room that he wiped hundreds of his boogs on then ate at a later time."

AskReddit,c0olyv5,"I am going to apologize for the long-detailed story now. When I was 15, my family decided to book a Caribbean cruise for xmas + new years. At the time, I was still very much a super-virgin, and by super-virgin, I mean I'd been nowhere and done nothing. No girlfriend, no boob-grabbage, no kisses, nothing. I was, shall we say, quite eager. So the cruise begins and my only thought is to just stay away from the family and maybe I'll get lucky. So the 3rd or 4th night of hanging out in the ""teen center"" was turning out to be as dull as the 1st few nights and I wasn't about to get out on the dance floor and lose my last shred of dignity to the Macarena remixed with the YMCA in hopes of gaining some female attention. 
 So about the 2nd time the Electric Slide comes on, I decide to roam the ship and wallow in my own self-pity. It's fair to say I got myself pretty lost and I eventually happened upon the Ship's Library, which had seemingly been taken over by a fair number of rogue teens of all ages sprawled around the various couches laughing and drinking what I thought was soda. I stumbled in abruptly and was greeted by this friendly crowd, handed a drink, and introduced to a number of girls, namely Shari and Jordana (should probably change those names but what the hey). 
 After mixing about and talking all about how we hate how boring life is and rules are stupid, we all decide to scour the boat for alcohol (I was a bit tipsy at this point). We all wandered to different parts of the boat and I decided to roam with the group with Jordana and Shari...oh and some guy named Mike. Well Mike and Jordana seemed to be pretty well off together arms around and giggling so I follow his lead and Shari seems to like it. WOW! We wander to the very top of the ship and sit on some lounge chairs. After a few minutes of small talk, and watching Jordana and Mike start hooking up, this girl just Lunges! And I'm kissing her, just like that. I couldn't believe it. 
 This goes on for what seemed like an hour but was probably more like 3 minutes and then Jordana interrupts us like ""hey now, get a room you two, I'm thirsty! let's get some alcohol!"" So we oblige and follow her below deck. Well I happened to have a cousin aged 21 aboard and after locating him in the casino, he agreed to help us out. He buys us some drinks and we take them to a secluded bar that is about closing for the night on the stern of the ship. So we are sitting and drinking in the corner of this bar laughing and suddenly Jordana falls out of her chair and is laying on the ground against the wall and beckons for Shari so she proceeds to lay upon her and the two of them just start going at it. Like full on making the fuck out right on the floor of the bar. Mike and I look at each other smiling, give a brief nod, and proceed to enjoy our good fortune. Well, at least that was what I was doing. At some point in the next five minutes, Mike's Penis decided to convince him he was not enjoying his evening and he simply bid us adieu and vanished to his cabin. I was simply dumbfounded by this, as was Jordana, and I don't know if he was just doing me a favor (yeah right) or had a girlfriend back home or some LOGICAL explanation for his actions but he was abruptly out of the picture and I was left alone with these girls. 
 So they're just laying there, prodding me with their feet, Jordana looking a bit upset about Mike's vanishing act and I notice some people are beginning to stare so I stand up and suggest we find some more alcohol or something and we're on the move. I vividly recall the moment when I was walking down the hallway with these two girls, feeling quite tipsy and still amazed by the fact that I was no longer a super-virgin, when all of a sudden Jordana turns, grabs me and proceeds to make out with me. Now I expected Shari to have issue with this but apparently it has become more of an affection competition and her response is to do exactly the same thing. So hooray for me. We go about this routine winding our way down the hallways, in elevators, nooks, crannies. It should be stated that I was sharing a Stateroom with my younger brother. Against my better judgement, I decide to take them there in hopes of there being no younger brother when we arrive. We somehow find our way and, holy shit, the room is empty. I close the door, lock the deadbolt, and do the chain. 
 Now, this room consists of one large queen bed and the wall is entirely made of Mirrors. So I sit, and watch myself enjoying my manhood. I'd say we got to about the part when all of our shirts are off and doing that stupid 3-way kiss thing I remember seeing on MTV at some point in my childhood and all I hear is click and I instantly know what is happening. I jump from the bed to see the handle turn, the deadbolt undo itself, and the door swing open, BREAKING THE FUCKING CHAIN. I glance at my lovely guests, whose faces have gone white and are covering their breasts. I look to the door but it's not my brother, as I had expected, but my father had decided to come grab a suitcase or some shit with some fucking random spare key he managed to obtain. He immediately realizes his error, apart from busting the fucking chain, and he backs out with a quick apology trying to erase the sight of underage tittles from his mind. This put quite an abrupt end to what was sure to be a night of bliss and they gathered their belongings and quickly vacated the room, too embarrassed to mutter a word. 
 The following day, my father approaches me, takes me off to the side and says, ""Son...I apologize for my intrusion but...isn't one enough?"" to which I shook my head and walked away and we never spoke of it again.

AskReddit,ckf4aq4,"I was 20, ROTC, already uniformed up for the day.  Tuesday was our ""uniform day"", since my military classes were that day.  Had TV on in the morning while prepping, but was some random crap, not news.  Get an IM about a bomb blowing up at the WTC, so I swap the news around. 
 See the reports, etc.  See the second plane hit, reports on hitting the Pentagon.  I'm standing in my room, watching the TV, already in my full uniform.  I'm the Flight Commander, and I have no idea what they'll have us do, so I start making calls. 
 First was to my morning class, we were having an exam in Differential Equations.  I call the professor up, say ""Two planes hit the WTC, one hit the Pentagon, towers collapsed, I have to see if I'm on alert or anything, so I'm not going to be able to take the exam today"".  She responds with a ""Ummmmmm...okay....if you REALLY don't want to take the exam, I guess you don't have to."" (I found out later she did not know yet, and thought I had created the most elaborate excuse in all history to delay my exam.  She apologized profusely to me, the next class, in front of everyone and made a point to thank me for my military service - though I was only ROTC, not some active Sargent.) 
 Continued calls to my flight, fellow students, alerting them.  I had a response of ""Really?  Holy shit!  What channel?"", and I replied ""Any of them"".  I know I forgot that one of the members, from California, had their family move to New York recently.  It made an awkward long silence on the phone after I told them, then they hung up. 
 I only had to stand by for any more instructions, and the military classes were cancelled.  I remember that three times that day, I couldn't go ten feet from a building without a car stopping and asking where I was walking, and they would drive me there (was still in full uniform). 
 Attended service/church that night, still full uniform. 
 Next day, I had my military commissioning ceremony.  Complete coincidence, but was an adrenaline rush to swear an oath (again) and be commissioned, in the face of all that happened.  At the end of the ceremony, all present were told not to wear military uniforms when not on bases, could be targets. 
 Went back to room, changed out of uniform, went back out to eat.  Along way there (or back), I came across the girl's volleyball team, out for a march, in formation, doing their military-like chants as loud as they could, dressed in camo/BDUs/military surplus junk.  I stopped them and informed them that it was not a good idea to wear uniforms and carry on like this, as I had just been ordered not to wear my uniform at all.  They gave me a bunch of lip and sass, but at that time, being a Flight Commander and trainer, I could handle sass-back and just stood firm on my point.  They dispersed, I followed up with the coach the next day as an FYI.  He said what they did was against their code of conduct, so he'd apply the consequences, sit them out of a game, etc.","Was in full military uniform, professor thought I made up most elaborate excuse to skip that day's exam, free car rides from strangers while in uniform, military commission the next day, and had to deal with girl's volleyball team showing huge disrespect to me/military just after my commission."

 It was one of our Birthdays and we decided to host a party in our Dorm. This one person who I will name K wanted to come and celebrate it with us and we thought why not. 
 Now person K, has been talking about this Kickboxing and self defense class she has been taking in order to protect herself. Person K is also one of the scrawniness, shyest, most timid, girl I have ever met. Believe me when I say this, I fear hugging her because I feel like I might breaker like a stick. I love her to death though since we have helped each other through countless ordeals. 
 Now I'm roughly 6foot, and weigh about 200lbs I'm a fairly big intimating guy. 
 I don't know why or where this idea comes to my head, but I decide to test her ability of self-defense. I'm justifying this to myself, by making her realize her true strength in a mock event, over a serious one with serious danger. 
 The day she is coming over it's well into the evening and its already dark the streetlights are on. I'm on a far away bench with the darkest clothes I can find just covering my face and keeping my eye out for her. I spot her and quickly judge the path she is taking to our dorm and cut through a path to get ahead of her. 
 I get ahead and I'm basically waiting at the edge of this building for her to get within striking distance, I'm wearing a hoodie that can cover my face and kind of slouched a little over just ready. I heard foot steps closing in and I just jump and grab the nearest individual. 
Now by my positioning and the way the hood covered my face I wasn't able to get a really good look at my ""victims face"" directly I was grabbing her around the shoulder you see, and a little ways behind my ""victim"" was K walking with my roommate, and they both have this DEER in the HEADLIGHT expression.

My dad got the speeding ticket, addressed to him, so I told him to check the box that said ""I wasn't the driver here. Leave me the fuck alone."" and mail it back. Usually you can just ignore speed camera tickets unless they serve you personally (which they almost never do), but my dad didn't wanna risk having a process server show up at his work. He never heard anything back about it so we assumed it was resolved. 
 3 months later, he gets a letter from a collections agency about the ""delinquent ticket."" He was annoyed about the ticket before, but now he's pissed off at me. It went from $250-ish to over $500. I asked if he had received any other warning letters about it and he said no, so I went to the court house with the ticket number, requested a hearing, and asked a clerk to pull the file including all correspondence. She hemmed and hawed and gave me the runaround, and was only able to produce the original ticket and my dad's response, but said she would send more info in the mail, including my court date. 
 Two weeks later: nothing. I head back to the court house and ask again. Clerk says the ticket was dismissed, no court date, the collections agency was called off, nobody had any outstanding debt, no bruises on anyone's credit report, it's like it never even happened. 
 Turns out that they sold the ticket to the collections agency without doing pretty much any of the work they were supposed to (i.e.: letting my dad know they had rejected his plea, sending out letters that he was past due, etc.).

AskReddit,circ81s,"This was my first and last tinder date. This girl met me with some mutual friends at a bar and we hit it off pretty well, she said she didn't really drink much but still had 1 mixed drink, I had quite a bit to drink. Things went well and she ended up staying at my place. We fooled around a bit but it only led to blue balls then passed out. 
 2hours later she comes back from the bathroom and tells me she needs to go to the hospital immediately due to intense stomach pains. It's about 4am I'm still drunk/tired/out of it but the hospital is close. 
 We arrive to the ER and I pull up a chair at her bedside hoping a family member or friend of hers would be able to come soon. Turns out she's new to town and they live far away. The nurses start asking me questions and I am of no use to them since I just met her last night. This leads to inquisitive glares and some speculation that I roofied her or worse. 
Then she gets a lot of painkillers and starts acting like I'm her knight in shining armor for staying with her. For the next 11 hours she asks the weirdest marriage type questions and brings up other stuff no-one ever should on a first date. I was hungover/exhausted in the er on a first date with someone who's turning into a stage 10clinger. 
 Finally her ultra conservative parents arrive, they are under the impression I'm her boyfriend, not a tinder date, we have an awkward exchange then I move as quickly as I can past the judging eyes of the nurses and finally can get back to bed.

I arrived late at the party and my friends are being beaten by the hottest girl I've ever seen in my life in drinking games(beer pong when i got there).  They ask me to join in so I can beat her and her friends.  We were playing 10 cups,me against the three of them and I had to take a shot every 5 cups because I was late. 
 After the first four losses she says they cant drink anymore. .  So I propose a solution, ever cup a piece of clothing comes off.  By the end of the game she is in her socks and her two friends are down to underwear, the guys at the party are thrilled and I'm feeling pretty good in my briefs.  After a few minutes I find out shes only 16, at which point I feel miserable and go find her a blanket to wrap herself in. 
 Later that night I went to lay down because I was tired.  I'm laying there with my eyes closed and hear something.  I open my eyes to this girl standing above me, wrapped in nothing but her blanket. ""You look kind of cold, need a blanket?""

AskReddit,c192xv0,"A couple of months ago I asked ""[What would you do with a $2000 to help it grow?](  I got a lot of great responses and am sorry to say that I was unable to try any of it. 
 The people on that thread that said I should save it were right. 
 My wife (reddit name -  THE_CAT  got really sick.  Just before Halloween, after recovering from two weeks of pneumonia, she got a weird sharp pain in her abdomen near where her gall bladder had been removed a few years ago. 
 Biggest problem = no insurance.  After four emergency room visits and 9-10 Primary Care doctor visits and two specialist visits, we are left with none of the $2000 that I had hoped to try to grow a bit before Christmas.  She is still in pain and my father is fronting the money for an endoscopy that will happen next week. 
 How that money would have really helped us right now: 
 When I met and married my wife 5 years ago she already had two beautiful kids.  They are now living with their father in Lubbock and we are in Houston.  Flying the kids home from their father's house for Christmas is WAY more expensive than driving.  So the plan all along had been to drive.  But now we can't afford that either.  Pain/health wise or money wise. 
 THE_CAT will likely do it anyway, driving the requisite 20 hours now and 20 hours at New Years to get the kids and take them back.  We will have to beg and borrow to get it done, but will will.

AskReddit,c2x0x4n,"In high school, we were rolling up the tennis court, when I...  I always start this story this way and enjoy the confused faces. But I can't see them now, so I might as well continue. 
 So my class had the fortune to complete the gym teacher's assignment which was to roll up the plastic tennis court in the back of the school and put it into the storage room of the gym. It took 10-12 members of our class to roll it up, so we line up on one end of the court, pick it up and start. The court doesn't have a flat bottom, it has ""spikes"" that rest on the ground, they are not very pointy, but still. So as we are rolling it, the spikes are facing towards us. 
 We're about halfway through, when I accidentally touched the spikes with my knee. That moment, I felt that if I try to resist, I can seriously hurt my knee, so I let my momentum carry my body all over to the other side of the rolling court (the part where it's still on the ground and not rolled up yet). The rest of my class are so funny, so they aren't breaking a stride, and almost roll me up with the court. Of course, they eventually stop. 
 So I have a moment lying there to observe my injuries. Basically, the spikes peeled off the skin from both of my knees, there's plenty of blood, I can barely walk.

AskReddit,c6musrh,"A little late to the party, but oh well. 
 Mine was the weekend my girlfriend at the time came up to visit.  She got sick from a virus, and spent most of her first night puking her guts out.  Every time she got sick, she would text me saying she needed me, and I would rush from my room down to the basement where we had our sofa-bed, and where my ex was sleeping.  I was probably woken up 5-6 times that night to help her.  I didn't mind, I wanted to comfort her no matter what. 
 The next day, she tells her parents what's going on.  They didn't do a thing.  They didn't offer to come up to my house to get her (a 2.5 hour drive), they told her to stay with us.  This seemed fine to me, since she was still quite sick, and a day of rest would help her.  So I spent that day with her, waiting on her hand and foot, making her soup, getting her Gatorade, doing anything for her.  My parents went out and bought food to help her settle her stomach, drinks, and Jell-O, which they then made for her. 
 The 2nd night, my ex still gets sick several times.  Same story, I rush down and help her, etc.  It's evident that she needs to see a doctor, she hasn't gotten any better.  The next morning, she calls her parents and ask them to come up to get her.  They get me on the phone and start barraging me with questions on why I haven't taken her to the hospital.  I explained that I didn't feel like she needed the hospital, just a doctor, and that I thought seeing a doctor in her hometown would be a better idea, since she could be there with her family, and be able to do all the necessary things to get better where it is most convenient for her. 
 The mother then tells me to take my ex's car, drive it to a town half-way between our houses, and she'll meet us there with my ex's sister.  I then asked if my ex's sister would be taking me home.  She said no, and told me that my brother should follow us in his car, and then he could drive me back.  I explained that this wouldn't work, since my brother was out of town with my dad, and my mom was at work.  So I asked again if my ex's sister could take me back home after driving to meet them.  My ex's mother said no, and that I should just wait in this random town until someone could pick me up.  I told her I couldn't do that, that they would have to come all the way up to get their daughter. 
 My ex got back on the phone with her parents, and they must have told her to break up with me, because she got off the phone and said we were done.  I didn't fight it.  I didn't want to be in that environment where her parents demand me to be left stranded in some town for an entire day, after I had done all that I could to help my ex get better.  And for them to not have come up first thing to get her after finding out she was sick was mind-boggling to me. 
 And for the icing on the cake, as my ex is packing her bag, she sees that her credit card had fallen out of her purse.  She didn't assume that the bag must have tipped over, and her credit card had fallen out.  Rather, she looked me straight in the eye and said she thought my parents stole her credit card to pay for the food, the Gatorade, and the Jell-O to help her get better.

AskReddit,c268vvp,"As a house, the amount of bandwidth we get is set in stone by whatever company we pay, right? 
 The amount of bandwidth that is transmitted over a dataline is determined by two basic elements:  the capabilities of the line (hardware, signal quality) and the configuration of the line (how the line is setup by the provider). 
 The amount of bandwidth that can be transmitted over your home internet service is thus dependent upon a theoretical maximum capability of the technology and the line itself (so, if you're using for example VDSL - there's a theoretical maximum of some 70+Mbps; and because the DSL signal degrades over distance, the quality of the line between you and the phone company, and the distance between you and the phone company.  Other techs work different, but this example illustrates the principle).   On top of that limit  the phone company will provision your connection based on their offerings (continuing the VDSL example, AT&T limits all connections to a max of 24Mbps, regardless of the line quality) and the limitations of your service (you may have only 6Mbps). 
 So there is a limitation on the bandwidth of your connection, yes. 
 The connection, however, is between your modem and the phone company.  You are correct to assume that this limit cannot be exceeded regardless of what happens inside your network, because the actual 'internet connection service' exists between the modem and the phone company.  Anything that you connect to the modem (that is capable of transmitting at full speed) will be able to give you 100% of that available bandwidth, assuming no service degradations on the line.","Yes, you get ""full bandwidth"" regardless of whether you 'plug in' or use wirelessly.  However, each user may  Not  experience an equal share of the bandwidth (so if there are 5 users, one connects via hardline and the others wirelessly, it's possible that the hardline user will get more bandwidth than the others - again, depending on your specific circumstances)."
AskReddit,cb363zc,"She's on anti-anxiety medication but our parents are not the best. We believe her father is bipolar (or has something similar going on) and he would be far from understanding in any case, he's just not that empathetic to begin with. 
 We're half siblings, she is from my mother's second marriage. Her father was removed from the house for physically abusing me, and I thought it would be all better. Turns out, my mother is terribly abusive (emotionally and verbally) herself and she tends to favor the youngest child (we have a younger sister, who is eight). So my little sister gets yelled at about as frequently as I used to, only I'm much older and it doesn't bother me. 
 I suspect it either led to or at least did not help her issues. She's really sensitive and wants everyone to be happy and not hurt all the time but she's got some issues due to the strong medications she's always been on. My mother also refuses to take her to talk to someone because my mother does not like to hear how people think she's done things wrong. I've tried many times to get my mother to take her to a therapist but she won't. She keeps saying she'll make appointments whenever my sister is having a 'bad spell' (behavior issues brought on by anxiety) but never follows through, and won't even hear about it when she's not doing as badly.","Yes, her parents know.

AskReddit,c9dl9r4,"Beta story time: 
 Back in high school I didn't have any female friends... the closest was this really cute girl that I had the biggest crush on. We use to sit next to each other, hang out in recess (and by hang out, I mean she didn't mind me following her around), text, and msn message each other all the time which was a HUGE deal to me back then. I thought this meant that we were real chummy and I was actually quite proud about the entire situation. Problem was, she had a boyfriend. Standard scumbag. 
 Anyway, they get into a fight and break up, and guess who's shoulder she decides to cry on? Yeah... Though, naive little me is ecstatic! Finally, my chance, the moment I had been waiting for. All I had to do was to be supportive, and she'd automatically fall in love with me, the guy who was there for her. After all, she likes me enough to talk to ME of all people about her breakup. I try my hardest to cheer her up, telling her she deserves better, that the guy was no good, etc. 
 So the next day in school I don't see her until recess. I'm sitting in the school cafeteria with a couple of friends when she walks up to me. I smile, and get up to hug her like usual... and out of nowhere... she start yelling at me. ""Who the hell do you think you are!?"" ""You fucking loser, don't you dare talk shit about x"" ""You low life, you don't know anything about me, or him"" etc. I'm standing there in shock, unable to get out one word, while she keeps trash talking me in front of the entire school... and when she was done, she just turns around and walks away. Turns out, she got back together with the scumbag boyfriend overnight. I stopped talking to her after that... and spoiler alert, they broke up again shortly after.","High school crush cries on my shoulder after break up, I am supportive, she makes a huge scene in high school cafeteria next day by yelling at me for talking shit about her ex."
AskReddit,c5lf8ue,"This one requires backstory, but I think it's hilarious. 
 I sometimes drive my friends home when they've been out clubbing because I don't want anyone drink driving or paying too much for a taxi.
Every now and then I take a female friend (We'll call her Sally) home and sometimes her friends need a ride so I take them home too.
One of Sally's friends, we'll call her Laura, used to always laugh at my jokes and think I was hilarious whenever I drove them home.
After driving them home a few times, Laura got my number from Sally and we started messaging each other. I asked her on a date to the movies and she agreed.

AskReddit,c0u8cd0,"Try chilling out. It's her life. Be honest, what reason do you have to be worrying? Why is it ""killing"" you inside? Why can't you sleep? 
 Be honest - it's because you think she's fucking around right? 
 So basically, you're saying you're worried because you don't trust her. It's important to be clear on that. 
 Here's a few pointers: 
 1) She probably is seeing someone else. 
 2) The more pathetic and worried you get about it the quicker she'll dump you for him. 
 3) Basing relationships on who's fucking whom is pretty stupid. Guess what, everyone wants to fuck other people. It's completely natural. If you love her because she's only fucking you then what the fuck sort of love is that? You love an exclusivity contract on her vagina or that's the most important thing in the relationship between you two? That's fucking retarded mate. There are billions of other vaginas in this world and hers is very unlikely to be particularly special. 
 I know, I know, you love her, not just her vagina. Right, that's great, then love her and tell her ""You know what, all this staying out you're doing - I was thinking maybe you've met someone else or you've been enjoying a bit of time to feel a bit free again. Just wanted to tell you I'm cool with that - I love you so I want you to be happy and enjoy your life. It's your only one. As much as I wish you were here with me sometimes I don't want that to hinder you in you making the most of your life. I'd rather keep it so that when we're together that's special for both of us, something we 're both choosing."" 
 Now, I don't know if you get how important that is, but when you started your relationship one of the things that made you feel great was that she was choosing you. When you take away the choice you take away the feeling, for both of you. It shocks me that more people don't get this, but they don't. My advice to you - let her do what she wants to do and be happy for her. If she's more than a personal vagina to you then you'll adapt to freedom and maybe continue to enjoy the feeling of being chosen for a special relationship with her. If she's not, then fuck it. She'll reject you soon enough anyway because she won't feel as though you're allowing her a choice.","STFU, and go out with your mates.

AskReddit,cire7ik,"So, a friend of mine starts talking to these two girls while we're staying in Galveston, and he convinces our buddy and myself to meet the girls at the beach with him. After meeting them, we realized that we had nowhere to go other than the motel room where our gay friend was, for whatever reason, asleep, and he aggressively told us before we left not to bring back the Tinder chicks and wake him up. Someone had the idea to go to a random hotel hot tub, so of course, we immediately did. So we drink, they strip and run around for fuck knows why (not complaining, just odd), and after a while one of the girls gets really sick and starts PROJECTILE VOMITING in and around the hot tub. It was really bad, I mean like, this chick was pressure washing the concrete with her puke. So, I held her hair back, and managed to get her some water that we'd brought in between volleys of Burnett's-laden barf, and all the while one of my friends was fingering the other girl in the hot tub. After a good half hour of the awkward aural overlap of moaning and puking, the two hot tub lovers decided to notice the situation, and we left. When we got to the motel, exorcist-vomit girl was doing better, so we decided to hang out for a while. Our gay friend refused to get out of bed so my buddy and his heavy-petting hot tub soulmate kept on keepin' on on the very edge of the bed while our gay buddy lay right in the middle. Meanwhile, my third friend lay in the other bed watching cartoons, and after a few awkward minutes of the bubonic chick and I chillin awkwardly on the floor with her apologizing for getting sick and thanking me for helping (she really was very nice), she started getting sick again, so she went to the toilet and proceeded paying homage to the porcelain god while I continued my role as hair holder-back-er and moral support giverer. Meanwhile, my friends and Ms. Tonsil Hockey, who had all gotten drunk since getting back to the motel, remained occupying their awkward positions. I hadn't driven from the loiter hotel, so I had drunk at the hot tub, and I was very drunk while all of this was going down. Somewhere in my poor, stupid, drunken head, I had had enough of Tinder, and I was quite done with the whole ordeal, so I adamantly declared that we were leaving, and we would take the Tinder chicks to little miss fingerbang's place. Of course, my friend who had instigated the whole thing agreed, and we left with him driving his new found spit-swapping partner's car and me driving his car. I know that drunk driving is a deplorable act, and I'm not proud of it, but we lead the chunk spewer down the stairs (fresh vomit at every other step), into the cars, and we drove them home. While I was taking a left turn at a stop light following my buddy, this chick opens the car door and tries to throw up while holding on to the door with one hand. Of course, I had to stop so she wouldn't fall out. Thankfully, the intersection was empty, so my friend stopped, got out, and helped me get barf-blast back in the fuckin' car. Right as we get in the cars and start pulling away, a cop rounds the corner and follows. As far as we could tell, he saw nothing, and he stopped tailing us as we turned onto the residential street where Juliet Jacuzzi lived. As we're pulling up to the house, this chick completely faints while I was opening the passenger door to help her out. Other than that, she wasn't exhibiting any symptoms of alcohol poisoning that were severe enough to warrant a hospital trip as far as her friend was concerned, so we warily trusted the hot tub harlot to take care of her friend. We made it safe back to our motel and drank some more to celebrate the many luckily-avoided catastrophes. My friend the Tindstigator happened to see the girls at the store the next day, and they had my shirt that the up-chucker had borrowed at some point after chucking up all over her shirt. I honestly don't remember her borrowing my shirt and changing into it, but I was nevertheless relieved to have it back.

AskReddit,c5nylrf,"I used to work in a real estate office as a receptionist. One of the things I was responsible for was receiving all the offers that came in and delivering them to where they needed to be. Even though it was illegal for my office to speak with buyers (we were only allowed to talk to their agents) buyers would constantly call and try to gain some kind of advantage. Usually they'd basically say ""we're just so in love with this house, I don't know what we'd do if we didn't get it"" or some horror story about a terrible landlord resulting in the buyer being forced to move. Having heard so many stories like that so many times, I stopped feeling sympathy for these buyers and would even become irritated by the fact that they persisted when I told them it was against the law for me to talk to them instead of their agent. 
 One day a man called and I prepared myself to say, ""I'm sorry sir, you'll have to have your agent call me..."" when he simply said, ""it was my fathers house. I just want to raise my daughters there."" I listened to a bit more of the story and learned that the house had been foreclosed on, and the family was unable to buy it back because the law here does not allow the previous owner to purchase a foreclosed home. His father began living with him until he passed away. The man told me he checked real estate listings every day until he saw it was for sale again, and that it would mean the world to him if he could raise his children in a house that meant so much to him and his family. I checked the property records and sure enough, it had been owned by his father, foreclosed on, purchased by someone else, and then listed for sale again. 
 I submitted his offer immediately. Other offers came in throughout the day, but only one was higher than his. The offer that was higher had a page missing. Technically the page was necessary before an offer could be submitted, but it wasn't that big of a deal and normally we'd just overlook it. But remembering the man's story, I called the agent that sent this offer and told him I needed that page before it could be submitted, knowing it would take a day or two. 
 As a result, the man ended up becoming the new owner of the house. When he came into the office to get the keys, he had tears in his eyes and simply said to me, ""I don't know what you did, or even if you did anything... But I just want you to know that what was surely a small thing in your life has had a huge, huge impact on mine.""

AskReddit,cirdogq,"Joined Tinder to prove to my roommate's coworker that it was easy to find matches. 
 For back story, He would constantly say ""Tinder is broken"" while he ""swiped right"" (aka ""Liked"", for those not acquainted with Tinder) EVERY profile until he ran out of profiles. He would then delete his app, re-download, and do it all again as an attempt to ""beat the system and populate himself to the top of these girls apps when they opened it"" (or something to that effect). At the end of the day he ended up getting matches he didn't prefer (because he was not being selective enough) and actually matched with a few guys (apparently guys will say they are girls to pop up on other guys' Tinders?

She was in the wrong, I pointed it out, she took it badly, after a talk I said something along the lines of ""It's over"", because at the time, I didn't see myself doing anything other than that. 
 Thing is, I always wanted her to some extent. She wrote me few weeks ago, but being with someone, and out of time, I didn't do anything. When the relationship ended, I wrote her back, and two weeks ago we've met. She has matured from a teenage girl into a beautiful, intelligent woman, and all the unresolved feelings came back, with nothing between us this time. Now I'm not certain whether to call her a girlfriend just yet, but Significant other seems fitting.","I guess it's hard to maintain a friendship when half of what you're feeling is sexual tension.

No big deal as this happens all the time. As I start working I learn that the woman of the house was on Flight 11 and it was her first business trip back after going back to work from maternity leave. I then realize that 2 years earlier I had worked at this couples wedding. It was truly a horrible situation to be in.

I arrived super late because catching the Metro down Wilshire at 6:30 in the evening can be a bitch, so I got there just as the doors were opening. Being too young for alcohol and too broke for a tee shirt, I parked myself as close to the stage as I could get without a wrist band and decided to pass the time by talking with the lady guarding the pit. Nothing major, just idle chit chat and little jokes about the increasingly creative excuses people were coming up with to get into the pit without a wrist band.

AskReddit,c0lwnmq,"For one thing, stop watching/reading the news. When you were a kid you were mostly oblivious to what was going on in the world. Becoming oblivious again won't hurt you. I struggle to understand why people equate knowledge of current affairs and news items to intelligence. The news paints a grim picture of the world. It is at the sensational extremes. 
 Neil Postman's book ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"" (recommended by a number of redditors, thanks) really opened my eyes to how useless and mostly irrelevant the news has become (especially tv news). 
 In other ways, you need to find a way to not dwell every day on the stresses and complications of adult life. These impinge on your ability to just enjoy things for what they are. Worrying doesn't change anything. Disengage a little. 
 When you were a kid, most experiences were new. You were unaware of or oblivious to consequences. You could and probably did just take things at face value. Recreating that requires suppressing some fear of consequences and discovering something new. Someone has already recommended travel. Other ideas could be studying a topic in depth for the sheer interest of it. 
 I always liked Donald Knuth's philosophy. He doesn't want to be on top of things, he wants to get to the bottom of things. That's why I mentioned avoiding the news. It puts you on top of things, at a superficial level. Anything that is really worthwhile knowing and will affect your life in the long term requires more than a 10 second video grab. 
 Try to surround yourself with positive people. This as much as anything turned me around. I made a conscious decision to cut negative people out of my life. Hanging around regularly with optimistic people changed me for the good. Not blind optimists, just people who want to take something positive out of an experience, or who want to find positive experiences. These kinds of adults still have that little spark of childhood wonder. 
 Finally, go to the park. Watch kids play. Watching my kids is incredibly cathartic. If all else fails I can live vicariously for a while through my kids.","Avoid the news. Don't dwell every day on your adult responsibilities. Find something new that interests you and ""get to the bottom of it"". Choose to be around optimistic and enthusiastic people.

Since my by now ex-gf and me haven't seen each other for over a month, our sex drive was pretty high. So we were sitting in the car, me on the seat behind my mum, my gf basically on the seat in the middle right next to me. Her  jeans had a hole at around the top of her right thigh. I don't know why or how I got the idea but I put my finger in to make her horny. I tried reaching for her panties, but the jeans were too tight. I let my finger in there though to make her horny :D
Than we talked about something, she laughed and I felt in that moment, I had some more space in her jeans with my finger. So I used that laughter to my advantage to get ""deeper"" and it worked out really well. Got right to her pussy. When she noticed that, her laughter had a kind of sudden ending and the way she looked at me, I'll never forget: Soooo horny. At first I gently struck her through her panties but soon I put them aside to go on skin to skin. I felt her getting wet. She wanted to return the favour a little and just straight up grabbed my clock - with my pants on of course. 
Keep in mind though, I was like only 2-3 feet behind my mother while my gf and me were basically having a little more than foreplay.

As soon as the road opens up we pass them and go on our way. 
 Not 30 seconds later they floor it and start tailgating us and flashing their lights so when the road widens again, we let them pass us. They drive into the tunnel directly ahead and then stop. After about a minute they start throwing lit fireworks at us (illegal in Colorado Springs) so we back off and they drive away. 
 We wait 5 minutes before continuing our drive and exit the last tunnel and start to head back down. Out of nowhere these guys turn their car on and start chasing us down. My friend (the driver) kinda flips out and decides that he needs to drive 50 mph down the winding gravel roads to Hellen Hunt Falls. The driver of the other car decides to as well. 
 So we are both excessively speeding and realize that these guys might do something stupid so I get on my phone and dial 911. As I am explaining the lady on the phone what is happening and trying to get a bearing on exactly where we are the call drops (lucky there was any signal at all in the mountains there) so I get to dial 911 once again and explain everything all over (and for whatever reason they cant just use the gps in my phone to find us). 
 By this point we are getting back to town and come across a red light, it being almost midnight there wasn't any traffic so the driver looks both ways and just goes, the car chasing us seemingly just goes and we start driving towards the closest police station.

AskReddit,c2b2oy1,"A man by the name of Mark Duggan was shot dead by officers from a Metropolitan Police unit called Operation Trident. Duggan had a gun and initially there were reports in the media that he may have opened fire on the officers, prompting them to return fire. The officer that shot Duggan has since gone on the record saying that he never claimed Duggan opened fire first but that he fired on Duggan: 
 > According to Sky the C019 firearms officer has said that he never claimed Duggan had shot at him. 
 > The firearms officer is understood to have told investigators that he opened fire because he believed he was in danger from a lethal weapon. 
 Subsequently it has emerged that Duggans gun was actually an imitation firearm that had been modified to be functional, and currently it's undergoing forensic examinations to determine whether or not it was used. Nevertheless it currently seems as though two shots were fired and both of them were fired by police officers. 
 Duggan's family were not informed of his death by the police - they found out about it on the news. A group of people (including, I believe, some of Duggan's family) went peacefully to Tottenham police station to try and get more information and to protest at the lack of communication from the Met. 
 The riots began later that night but it's felt that the peaceful protest against the particulars of the Duggan case was hijacked. A Guardian journalist (Paul Lewis I think, but I'm not certain) said on Newsnight tonight that on the first night of the riots many of the rioters were specifically shouting things relating to Duggan's killing but that this was not happening anymore. Duggan's family have opposed the rioting. 
 On the other hand some people are arguing that the riots have partly  been caused by government policies. I thought this article, [If the rioting was a surprise, people weren't looking]( made a pretty good argument. Similar view were expressed by the former London mayor Ken Livingstone on Newsnight earlier, while some of the other guests argued that the riots are purely an issue of criminality with no real causes other than the perpetrators being criminals. 
 I know that actually doesn't give a concrete answer to your question, but to be honest even reporters in the UK can't come to a clear conclusion as to the definite causes. 
 On a side-note, virtually every relevant politician of any importance was on holidays when this started, and many of them are only coming back now: the prime minister was on holiday (now flying home on night 3 of the riots), the deputy prime minister was on holiday (returned on day 2), the home secretary was on holiday (returned on day 3), the mayor of London was on holiday (returned on day 3), the leader of the opposition was on holiday (returning tomorrow possibly?) and the deputy leader of the opposition was on holiday (ditto).","Drug squad killed a suspect, people were angry over lack of police communication with public. Riots happened. Uncertain whether all these things have actually got any causal link."

 This cute blonde and I matched about a month ago.  We started talking for a few days then exchanged phone numbers.  I went on vacation and we texted basically the entire time.  So far so good.  I get back and we agree to finally meet.  Side fact, I'm fairly paranoid and somewhat impatient.  The plan is to meet at 3 pm then she would go to work at 5.  I'm nervous.  This girl's cute, nice, funny, and I finally get to meet her.  Nope.  She goes to her community college and supposedly it takes hours to sign up for classes so we have to reschedule.  The whole time she's there I'm sitting there with butterflies in my stomach in anticipation.  We text for the rest of the day and decide we'll just meet up for lunch the next day at noon.  ""Cool sounds good, night.""  The next day I wake up around 11 and shower, get ready, all of that.  Knots in my stomach.  Paranoid she won't show up or will reschedule.  11:50 I leave and let her know I'm on my way.  My stomach is churning with paranoia and nervousness.  I get there at noon and am seated at the new Mexican restaurant.  I let the waitress know there's someone else coming. And wait. And wait. No text response.  It's 12:45.  She stood me up.  How did I know for sure?  She had a snapchat Mystory of her at Runza.  I had never had such a surreal feeling of anger, embarrassment, and pity.  She must've blocked me from texting her or something because I sent her a strongly worded message and she never read it.

AskReddit,c6xlop9,"Here's my pro-cursive rant. 
 I use cursive almost every time I write, because it's faster and more consistent. I only have to lift my pen between words, and the flow makes sure that my letters are consistent (e.g. all of my cursive 's' look the same, which I can't really say for my printed 's' when writing fast). I find it to be a genuinely useful skill, and the only real downside is that a large number of people can't read my cursive. It's not particularly messy, mind you, just that because most people don't use cursive they are not used to reading it. I am glad that I learned it at a young age, and it's really not that hard anyway. 
 The real problem is that teachers tell you that after you learn cursive, you HAVE TO use it forever. Of course people don't like being told that they have to do anything, so many children reject cursive. Of course you don't HAVE TO use cursive, but the same can be said of anything they teach you in school. 
 
 You don't HAVE TO use math everyday, but if you can understand high-level math, you will find yourself more employable. 
 
 You don't HAVE TO learn and remember history, but doing so can give you insight into the future and how society and government functions. 
 
 You don't HAVE TO learn how to use the English language effectively, but doing so will make you more employable and will make people take your ideas seriously. 
 
 You don't HAVE TO learn a second language, but it sure comes in handy when traveling and can unlock employment opportunities. 
 
 You don't HAVE TO run laps around the gym every day, but a fair amount of exercise has a number of benefits for your appearance and health. 
 
 
 And then: 
 
 You don't HAVE TO use cursive, but it is a much more efficient way of writing. 
 
 Another problem with the way that cursive is taught in schools is that it is easy to judge whether or not someone is writing in cursive. This is a problem because you can't really ""fake"" a cursive test, whereas you could fake a test on literature or history.  Math shares this problem: generally you either get a math problem right or wrong. And what subjects have the most complaints? Math and cursive. If you really don't get it, you're going to fail and it's going to be frustrating, unlike other subjects where a poor understanding of the subject may be enough to pass if you are clever.","your education is what you make of it, cursive included.

I got a slip for Saturday school - a 4 hour morning trash pickup around the school grounds - took it home to my dad and told him what happened, and my dad said I wasn't going to be punished for something I didn't do, so I didn't have to go. After about a month of skipping out on Saturday school (my dad told the dean's office I was not to be punished because I didn't do it, but they persisted) I was issued an in school suspension, wherein I was to sit in a study hall type environment instead of go to my regular classes. Mind you, I was in all advanced classes, where it could literally kill your GPA to miss a day. But I got advanced notice of this suspension, so my dad called me in sick the day I was supposed to go. Like the Saturday schools, my dad and I danced around this punishment as well. Until one day, where they sprung a surprise in school suspension on me. I refused to go, my dad agreed, so they finally suspended me for a day and sent me home.

A TAD is essentially a small screw that they screw into your gums; and when they put it in they used a lot of local anesthetic. However when they had to remove it they used nothing to numb my gums, and they just took it out.

AskReddit,clnjbfw,"A pie includes fat, proteins and carbohydrates which are all neended by the human body and while a piece of cake (depending on the recipe and how big it is), may contain more fat and sugar than reccomended, atleast it sustains you with energy. 
The chocolate in the pie contains cocoa, which itself contains minerals like potassium (required for transmitting nerve impulses and regulation of the waterbalance in cells) and magnesium (metabolism and muscle-/nerve functions) as well as vitamin E (protects cells from free radicals. 
Cream cheese contains potassium and magnesium too, along with calcium (bone structure, blood clotting), phosphor (energy metabolism and construction of cell walls) , cinc (cell division and immunesystem) and vitamin A (cell growth, health of skin and mucous membranes, beneficial to the eyes). 
 There may be healthier ways to get those minerals, vitamins and trace elements, but a cigarette, to my knowledge, contains no ingredients that are beneficial for the human body. 
 A cigarette does however (depending on the brand) contain about 200 chemical compounds that are poisonous and 40 that can cause cancer. (The chances of getting cancer from just one cigarette are pretty slim, so I'm going to ignore these for now and concentrate on short term effects). 
 According to EU law one cigarette may contain up to 10 mg carbon monoxide (CO). CO gets easier attached to red blood cells than oxygen (O), therefore exacerbating oxygen absorption. 
 Cigarette smoke also contains irritant gases like ammoniac (caustic effect on the mucuous membranes), nitrogen oxides (irritant towards respiratory organs) and bitumen (adheres the cilia making it harder for phlegm to be coughed up, though the effect is once again mostly related to smoking for longer periods) 
 Nicotine accelerates the heartbeat and constricts the blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure and weakened skin resistance (meaning increased sweating which leads to a lower body temperature). 
 While the short term effects of smoking are not that dangerous, contrasted with the chocolate cheesecake, the cigarette still comes up short. 
 A person with a healthy lifestyle will not be harmed by eating a piece of cake every now and then, cake only becomes unhealthy when paired with a lack of exercise, high intake in calories and cholesterol and malnutrtion that lacks vitamins and minerals (as stated above a chocolate cheesecake does contain some, but there are way better sources to get your fill on vitamins), but a cigarette is always harmful.","The cake is healthier, because it contains ingredients that are beneficial for humans, while a cigarette has a solely negative effect."
AskReddit,chl93oh,"I have this story that I tell all my friends, so I guess I'll share it since a few people still don't believe me. 
 When I was in the third grade, my parents had just gotten a divorce. My mom took my little brother and I and moved us into an apartment complex in a really shitty north Texas town, where she enrolled us in an (exceptionally awful) elementary school. 
 So throughout my few accumulated years of school, I had only brought a boxed lunch to school two or three times, so I had basically always lived off of school cafeteria food. 
 Those few years of school food were not enough to prepare me for the glorified concrete I would soon ingest. When lunch came around on that first day at my new school, we were given assigned seats in the cafeteria. The teachers, who were supervising the cafeteria, let one table go at a time to buy their lunch if need be, and I was seated at the last table (since my last name was at the end of the alphabet). When my table was released to the lunch line, I followed all the other kids and grabbed myself a heaping, cold tray of food. I don't remember what was on my plate, but I'm sure it wasn't anything healthy. 
 The next day came, and I was sitting in a computer lab before lunch practicing my typing on the school computers with my other classmates. As I typed, I could tell I really needed to poop, so I raised my hand and excused myself. 
 This computer lab has a second door that opens to the cafeteria, so I cut through the empty cafe to the bathroom on the opposite side. I walk in and sit myself down on my own temporary porcelain throne, ready to release this ass kraken once and for all. 
 Unfortunately, my underdeveloped, eight-year-old butt muscles had not prepared me for this endeavor, and I left the bathroom helpless and defeated with a shit the size of Texas itself corked in my bum. I could hardly sit down when I returned to the lab. 
 I went to the bathroom two more times at school and three more times at home, praying to Baby Jesus himself as I tried and failed to release this ass kraken from my bowels. 
 The next day, I tried again a handful of times, with no success. 
 The day after, I tried again. Still nothing. 
 Then again. And again. For two whole weeks. 
 I had given up on the poop lodged inside me by then, utterly defeated both physically and mentally by the fecal parasite inside me that I assumed had molded to the shape of my small intestine. 
 My mom came to pick me up from daycare the following afternoon and I uncomfortably shuffled myself, weak and wounded, into the backseat of the car. My mom had pointed out to me that I had been looking sick for a few days. When I buckled up, she pointed out that I seemed to be looking worse. Probably because of the shit plug inside of me. 
 Two weeks was too much for me, though, so I finally gave in and told her that I hadn't pooped for two weeks straight, to which she drove me to the hospital immediately. 
 I was put into a hospital bed and hooked up to an IV. The doctors came into my room and did all the usual stuff. Some time passed, and I failed time and time again to poop my life out into the hospital bathroom across the hall. And then, lo and behold, the doctor walked in with a fucking  slushie  in his hands, and it had my name on it. It was grape flavored. I was so fucking pumped when I saw it. I took a swig and discovered I had probably drunk the remains of a liquified, slushy pig liver, laced with poop that had probably been scraped out of the cave that was my own butthole. Basically, it tasted like shit. Its artificial grape flavoring was nearly completely saturated with Ex-lax. It was disgusting. 
 I got a couple CAT scans in after I was forced to drink half of the medicinal slushie, and nothing was really wrong with me. I just hadn't pooped in days. 
 After a while, I was lying in my hospital bed at 11pm, a shell of who I once was. I felt the Ex-lax move inside my stomach. After a moment of identifying that the uncomfortable pressure in my ass was, in fact, my bowels moving, I dashed to the bathroom across the hall. 
 To this day, I'm sure the ghost of my monster poop still lingers in that hospital bathroom. I clogged that toilet  twice . I'm still not sure how I lived through that.","One time in the third grade, I didn't poop for two weeks. 
 Also, I'm pretty good at drawing sheep. Most people don't believe that until I prove it to them, for some reason."

AskReddit,cgr4v8m,"So a bit of background first. I live in the US, and I think our form of government was awesome for the time... Might I even say, revolutionary. But a few problems have crept up over the years. Things like the corrupt party system and the [spoiler effect]( have turned out to be causing a lot of problems. While things like the electoral college are simply outdated when information can now travel faster than a swift gallop. 
 So on to my solutions for some of the problems that are currently causing problems for our government. 
 Problem 1, Politicians! Solution: All members of elected office are to be elected by lottery... OK, I kid. But I still feel that politicians, specifically from our two large idiot parties are the biggest problem we have at the moment. Mostly because all candidates for presidency and most other offices are receiving massive brib... I mean campaign contributions from [all]( [sorts]( of unethical businesses whose interests are not aligned with those of the average citizen. 
 A fix? I think that we need to make room for third parties, and set up a form of government that allows multiple viewpoints to contribute to the discussion instead of simply allowing the party with 51% of the vote to make all the decisions for four years at a time. After all, if we assume that on many issues in the country, people's opinions are represented by a Gaussian distribution, then our representatives should not be limited to the Tea party and the members of /r/socialism. (No offence /r/socialism, I know a bunch of you are pretty nice people but I don't really want you running the country.) 
 Sooo, to start our fixes, ditch the office of the president. Replace it with a five member tribunal. All citizens may vote for one person to be on the tribunal, whoever gets the most votes leads the tribunal, the other four are basically a descending order of vice presidents. When it comes time to sign an executive order or a bill into law it requires 4 votes from the tribunal, the leader has 3, everyone else has 1. Each party may only submit a single candidate for the tribunal. This would mean that at least the five most common opinions would have a representative at the executive level. In theory anyway. 
 Senators would be elected using something like [instant runoff voting]( still sending two representatives from each state. 
 Congress would allocate seats based on population of each state. And representatives from each state would be elected simultaneously from the same pool. However, representing the most popular positions equally would be unfair, because if a state has 95% democrats, 4% republicans, and 1% libertarians, the far majority opinion would be underrepresented. So after beating the next closest opponent and beating a certain margin the elected representative could pass on his spare votes to another candidate. In the case above this would allow the democratic candidate above to use ~90% of those votes to elect similarly minded representatives as himself, however the republicans and libertarians would still get a representative sent to D.C. for them. 
 Finally parties and candidate would not be allowed to collect campaign donations. Lobbying would essentially be outlawed. Campaigns would be payed for out of a tax fund. Each party receiving it's share based on what percentage of the populace listed themselves as a member in the previous election year. 
 Alright, that is all I have for now. Let me know any comments or criticisms. This is basically a thought experiment but I would be happy to keep evolving it.",Replace president with 5 guys who received the most votes for the office. Better voting system for senate and congress. Ban lobbying.

 Three girls other than myself and I believe 8 guys decided to play spin the bottle. Two of the other girls and I wound up getting totally topless, while the fourth was completely stark-ass naked. One of the other girls and I were dared to blow one of the guys in front of everyone else, so she got on her knees for my buddy's roommate (whom she was interested in), and I got on mine for my buddy who invited all of us, whom I was fucking at the time. I don't remember how many awkward makeout sessions and titty sucking dares ensued after that, but once we were all pretty blasted, I was dared to eat out the chick who got completely naked. She was my roommate at my own apartment at the time. Being the trooper I am and having always been curious about it, I did it. I ate her out in front of 2 girls and 8 guys, all totally shitfaced.

AskReddit,c31smga,"When I was in college I worked at a on-campus dining hall as a manager. In addition to the regular  shitty  wonderful options, we also had a ballroom for catered events. As a manager I was required to work at least 2 every quarter. One night we were catering a wedding and  another manager  went into our stores, grabbed a bottle of champagne, went into our back storage room and got drunk. She was maybe 19 at the time, mind you. She then came back down from the storeroom, and WENT TO MY EMPLOYEES BRAGGING THAT ALL MANAGERS GOT DRUNK ON SHIFT. Needless to say I wasn't completely thrilled. (Hey, the managers only got drunk  before   after work.)
She was fired on the spot, and the other managers and I got to have an extremely lovely (read:  terrifying,  as my boss is freaking nuts, and I wasn't sure I was going to make it out of that meeting alive) meeting where we all got our asses handed to us on a platter.

AskReddit,c5pcn39,"OH GOD. 
 I have one. Obviously a throwaway here. This is probably among the more disgusting things I've done and definitely worth sharing. 
 This was senior year of college. The day after graduation. We all woke up in a haze, induced over the last weeks at the awareness that civilization as we knew it, the best years of our life, were ending. As we awoke the next morning, our college campus indeed looked like civilization had ended with most of the student community having moved out and cleared out. Rome was burnt but we were the last warriors left (mostly because the leases on our houses were not running out till the end of May and we were trying hard to avoid the reality of life). 
 Across from us, the next house over, had lived THE HOTTEST GIRLS in our year. Most of the men on campus had fantasies about them and a very lucky few got to live them (including yours truly, but only because the girl and I were EXTREMELY DRUNK and she was probably having a moment of low self-esteem when anything with a penis would have sufficed and I, a moment of alcohol-induced alpha maleness, pretty sure I wouldn't be so lucky in any other state). Anyway, I digress, but in a good way. 
 The girls had cleared out but had left the door to the house open and so a bunch of us guys, after toking up a bit (coz what else are you gonna do?), decided, since we had nothing better to do, to be creepers and check out their place for lost treasures. The house was mostly a mess. So we made our way upstairs where the bedrooms were. As we reach the top of the stairs, what do we find? Lo and behold, lying stage center of the common area between the rooms was a stack of underwear. Sexy, sexy underwear, used and worn all year by the sexiest women on campus. We did not know which belonged to who but our stoned minds all wandered in the same horny and disgusting direction. 
 We all knew what needed to be done. We, the last remaining vestige of the men of our year needed to rise up to the challenge and leave our mark on this house of the holy, this temple of pure cardinal bliss where goddesses had resided. We each set out to find our few favorite pairs based on style, color, shape, material among other considerations. Then we each chose a room, maybe subconsciously choosing our favorite among the four, and then went in to let fly the juice of our pure lust on these garments. Then we silently walked out, dropped the now defiled underwear on to the stack and walked away silently, but with an assured feeling of victory having been achieved, as if the Garden of Venus itself had been conquered. Suffice to say, once sobriety set in, we came back from our high, the reality of the low point we had reached set in. Not much has been spoken of that day since it occurred well over half a decade ago and we have never encountered those women in our lives except from the occasional facebook posting, which seem to suggest most of them are now happily married. Little do their husbands know.","Jizzed into and using the underwear of hot girls who lived next to us during college, after they had moved out. College, I love you."
AskReddit,c733rfy,"Not personally rich, but I know a lot of rich people through friends, parents, etc. 
 Their opinion is that the plan is a great one. However, we are all in Canada where the highest income tax bracket is 29%, plus 10% flat provincial in Alberta [source]( There are also significantly fewer tax loopholes. That 29% is getting paid, regardless, and exemptions and breaks can maybe knock 1 or 2 percent off, max, since most investment income is taxable as income, rather than handled as a separate capital gains tax. An accountant will have a better-informed view, though. 14% effective rates are just ridiculous by comparison, especially since the US has a higher average salary and a lower cost of living. Not to mention that the highest tax bracket hits at about 130k per year, compared to the USA's 388k. 
 Mostly, what they agree with more is the elimination of loopholes. Transparency is important to them.","Canadian rich folk are living with a good 10%+ more in taxes, and very much enjoying it. I've heard the phrase ""whiny greedy Americans"" a few times."

AskReddit,c3iutm1,"So back when I was living with my parents during the college years, I had my car broken into on the street. 
 The next month, I decided to sleep in from school and go to my afternoon classes instead. When I woke up, I heard the house alarm going off. Super loud and instantly I run into my closet and grab a 10 pound weight and one of my drumsticks. In my boxers I locked myself in my closet (walk-in). I called the police. They put me on hold. THANKS btw.  (Also, NOT the only time I've been put on hold by the 911 people)

 They still sent an officer out later, about 30 mins later to check on things. Embarrassing!!","I almost got murdered.

AskReddit,cm60jf2,"Small businesses around my neck of the woods usually have residential equipment. Most franchises (Subway, Wendy's etc) are about a 50/50. It depends how long that particular store has been there, whether or not they're in a shopping center (many strips have 1"" supplies, which won't feed an 1 1/2"" commercial toilet obviously). Newer places and giant monster stores are always full commercial, even if it's not technically a public restroom. And beyond that, of the more commercial restrooms around here I see almost as much Zurn. And even many commercial restrooms use faucets with the same guts as the commercial ones. If it's T&S or Chicago that's one thing but usually a Moen is a Moen is Moen (unless it's a Kohler or something. If it's a Delta you're on your own. I can't stand a Delta). And you'd be surprised how often stuff just needs tightening. 
 In the case of a commercial restroom, due to cost, if I notice something I'll strike up a conversation with the owner and give them my contact at the local supply house. I've written down instructions for replacing a diaphragm, handle, sensor, or actuator more times than I can count. YSK if you're a small business owner it's worth buying an A-50 super wrench for just such an occasion, but anyone can do it with a screwdriver and a pair of channel locks (or in the case of sensors, an Alan key also). Although, for some reason, in some cases actually rinsing the diaphragm off (I know, I was shocked it worked too) will extend its life long enough to get in a replacement as supply houses in my area don't stock most commercial equipment. 
 But, again, if it's something as simple as an o-ring I'll come back with one at my leisure. Being a plumber (on a maintenance crew so I don't actually do solicited work anymore) I know I'll use it commercially if they hire someone in the time it takes me to address it at my convenience. This isn't something I do systematically, although if I could figure out a way to make non-profit plumbing a feasible thing I'd do it. Non-profits are apparently a nightmare to try to live off of.","1)many but not most in my area. and they're easier than people realize besides. 2)while doubt is the cornerstone of rational thought, in this case it is misplaced."

He gave me his number and texted me every night for two weeks. We finally hung out, he introduced me to all of his friends, and even put his arm around me when we were with them. One night, after watching movies at his house, we kissed. After that, we started sending flirtier texts, kissing more often, and I was really excited.

AskReddit,c0f2aaq,"Meme: (pronunciation MEEM) something that spawns on internet message boards and wreaks havoc across the globe. The specific meme of ""I see what you did there"" had the original intent of being a  sarcastic response to an obvious attempt by another Internet user (or /b/tard as shall henceforth be known) to force a response from a secondary, more novice Internet user (henceforth be refered to as n00b). The meme, though, has since taken on its own, very different, meaning. That meaning being a quiet look of admiration for the wit of the /b/tard. 
 In the context which it has been used by this user, it shall be deemed appropriate by both definitions. First of all the original /b/tard may have been trying to get n00bs to install the program known as ""Bonzi Buddy"" onto their system, which will then proceed to hijack the system with a large, green parrot, or, alternatively, a large purple, gorilla, who will proceed to harass the user about sins that he/she has committed. Namely not paying BONZI Software ltd. copious amounts of money. 
 Secondly it is in the realm of possibility that the /b/tard was simply being sarcastic. 
 To summarize, the usage was correct, though not as witty as it generally is.","Yea, I know. But I couldn't think of anything else to write."

I didn't know the girls that well, but I went to a small school and anything to do on a hot summer night was welcome.  We hung out at a park kicking a soccer ball around until they got bored and suggested that we hang out at my house, since my parents were out.  We raid my parents liquor cabinet and the 4 girls and I proceed to drink about a handle of vodka, although I probably drank half on my own.

AskReddit,c5pgt9d,"My turn, and I'm sorry for it being this long. 
 When I was a 17 year old virgin I was all into randomly finding girls on ICQ (Yes, that long ago). I must say with no success. One day this girl starts talking to me, so of course I rolled with it.We shall call here Alex. I ask Alex for her age and she says 16. We start talking every day, got her phone number after a week or so, so I called. Much to my relief a girl answers the phone and we have a very nice chat. She send over a picture, very cute, I get all exited. We start having some cyber-sex, no vid only text (this was a long time ago), at this point I was on cloud nine. 
 She mentions to me some family issues, abusive father and brother, some messed up shit, but she sounded ok so I carried on. 
 All this leading up to a day where I get a phone call from an unknown number. He tells me he's Alex's brother, not a good sign. He starts yelling at me, telling me Alex is only 11 and I should lose all contact with her or he will call the cops on me. I was shitting bricks for days. 
 After about a week Alex calls me up. Telling me how her brother and father are lying to me about her age because some excuse about them being something something, I don't remember what she said but I believed her. So we continue talking and having phone sex and all for another month. But then I get a phone call from her father, shit, I'm shaking thinking of it. They cancel her phone and monitor her e-mail. 
 For the following year I get two emails from her telling me how sorry she is for lying to me and that bullshit. But even then I wish she was my age and we could run away and be together, It was a nice fantasy. 
 Fast forward 5 years, I get a message on facebook from Alex, asking if I'm who she thinks I am. I say yes. We start talking again, she was even more amazing this time around. We decide to meet up in her place (she was living with her mom now In a main city close to me). She looked amazing, just like I imagined her. We go for a walk and start fooling around. We go back to my car and I drove to a park near by. I start going down on her when I hear some people near by. So we put on our cloths and drive away to a different place. 
 Then I realize how wrong It was, she was 16 and I was 22. I couldn't go on with it and I tell her that. She got pissed at me but understood me. 
 We met a few times afterwards just for some beers and shit, we kissed and stuff but never did we have sex, even when she turned 18.

 Private companies are allowed to pay their employees whatever they want because it's their money. If you think their value is not commensurate with their pay...then, at worst, the company is making a poor business decision, to their own detriment and no one else's. 
 Public charities are not allowed to pay their employees whatever they want because they exist for the public good. We grant them tax exemptions, and we encourage private individuals and organizations to donate money to them. In return, we receive a promise that none of their earnings inure to the benefit of any shareholder or individual. That means no one can ""make money off it""; they can only receive fair compensation for what they do for it. 
 Other non-charity non-profits, however, can likewise pay their employees whatever they want. Like the NFL. We don't care how much the NFL commissioner is paid because it's not our money.

 The worst part is you're basically bound from doing anything about it once you agree.  My wife would not kick them out for any reason (or allow me to), despite them not living up to ANY promises they made to move in.  My wife is just too caring for her family, and can't say no.

AskReddit,c80jh7n,"I have had episodic CH for the past 4 years. Every spring and autumn around when Daylight Savings Time kicks in (American laffo) they show up and stick around for 2 months each cycle. Most of my attacks happen at night, waking me up around 2-3am, but there are times when I get attacks during the daytime. Even with the obscenely disturbed sleep I prefer the attacks to happen at night because fuck that whole sunlight thing. 
 For me, when a cycle starts, it's at least 1 guaranteed headache every other night with definite chance of having another 1 or 2 as well during that 24-48 hour period. For 2 months. 
 The pain is excruciating, sure, but that vanishes without a trace after a while. The most damaging thing about CH is the insane depression while a cycle is happening. I can't drive during a cycle as the abortive I take ruins my sense of balance. I can't socialize with people outside of my home because I'm terrified of what options I have if I'm in public and get a headache.

I was terribly bullied back in grades 5,6,7 and I was too scared to stand up for myself, but there were kids that were even lower than me on the social ladder. I used this to my advantage and I gained respect from other people through putting them through what I've been through. That carried on for a few years until I went to a summer camp when I was 14 and I was put in the same cabin as one of the kids and I got to know him better. As it turns out, this kid was really cool and I immediately realized how wrong it was to put people through what I've went through, because I know it hurts and I don't want other people feeling the way I've felt. So after that one week in camp so much had changed and I really grew as a person, I made sure to apologize to him and I started trying to make thinks ok between us.","got bullied, bullied someone else and went to camp with him, he was a nice guy and I felt bad so I apologized and made things right"

AskReddit,c4keyf2,"When I was first in College I was so poor that I lived on the couch at my best friend's families house for my first year. (My family had abandoned me when I was 15 and moved away and I kicked around where people would have me.) His family had serious money problems as they were providing for my friend who was 21 going to college, fraternal twins (boy & girl) who were 18 and fresh out of high-school, a daughter who was 14 and me. Her husband had been laid off and had encountered some health problems so he couldn't help out much. All the kids except the youngest had jobs and worked very hard so they could have some spending money and help provide for the family. 
 This was an Italian-American family I'll call the mom Momma Ricci she was a loving mother and cooked lasagna and meatballs and in general great food for everyone. She struggled to feed us. (I consider her as my mother.) She had a business but it was failing. (Non-ent Herbs and natural remedies.) 
 The boy of the twins, Michael had graduated early and had been working construction full time to save up for college and for a car to commute the 45 minute drive to college. He had only cashed his first two checks and had saved 8 paychecks. He hadn't even deposited the rest. 
 One day when I came home from school he proudly took me to the garage and showed me the wheels he had got a great deal on that he was planning to put on the Civic he was going to buy after one more check. He was so happy. 
 That night after she had cooked us dinner I overhead Momma Ricci talking to her husband and I overheard the words ""mortgage"" and ""eviction notice."" The next morning when Michael was getting ready to go to work his mother dropped the bomb on him. She said we were facing eviction in a week and that they were $8500 behind on the mortgage payments. She told Michael she knew he had been saving his paychecks and that he had saved $9000. She asked him to save the home and family from the streets, and if he would be willing to do that for us. 
 He didn't bat an eye. he said ""Mom of course, I'll go to college next year."" Tears all around.

AskReddit,cm8p2zp,"A guy I used to be friends with went to rehab while we were in high school.  When he got out of rehab he moved to Kensington for about a month and the most fucked up true story I know is a three way tie all attributed to this catastrophic marvel of a man. 
 Part one: Fred relapses.  Fred starts doing heroin immediately after getting out of rehab.  He shoots up in a park one night and a fellow addict asks him to shoot him up in his back and Fred obliges.  The other guy overdoses and dies.  Fred pretty much just killed a guy and what does he do? Takes his money and dope and leaves. 
 Part two: Fred gets laid.  Fred spends the money from the above story on a three day pcp binge.  He tells me he blacked out for most of it but all he remembers is waking up in someones back yard, pants down around his ankles, on his knees.  He was fucking! Pretty cool right? Wrong.  Fred wasn't fucking some nice man or woman who lived in that house, he was fucking their dog. ""Base deep in the dog, just about to jizz and BAM! Sirens!  So I kicked off my pants and booked it"" as he told me. 
 Part three:  Fred smoked me up.  Now before Fred went to rehab we were really good friends and we would smoke weed together a lot.  In fact before he left it was an every day thing, we'd get out of school and I would get in his truck and we would smoke.  Everyone that we hung out with loved smoking with Fred because Fred always had the best weed.  Or so we thought.    We all got really really sick when Fred disappeared to rehab.  Throwing up, shaking, always cold but sweating.  Must have been a bug going around we thought.  When he came back to grace us with his tales of debauchery we were greeted with the confession that he would mix other things with the weed all the time so he would always have people to smoke with.  He wanted to get us hooked so we would smoke with him.

AskReddit,cb3r8vo,"I only just realised that I've been in love with one of my best friend for the past 5 months. I had known her for quite a while beforehand, but we never really got talking. But during a mutual friend's party we drank together and had one of the most deep and meaningful conversations that I ever had before. We shared all our personal secrets and from that day on we started sharing this special bond together. 
 I'm one of those guys who never really open up to people. I guess it's because I have a really big trust issue from past events. So to pour it out to a complete stranger during that night, and to hear her stories as well, made me feel like I'm not alone in this world, and that she was also someone who has her stories. Nevertheless she became someone special to me, and we constantly meet up to have 'chats' about life. 
 You might wonder why I'm unhappy though. It's because a month ago I shared a very intimate moment with her. We went out drinking and the next thing I know we were making out in the corner of a club. We used to talk about having a meaningless fling since we were both very vulnerable and lonely but we realised that we didn't want to jeopardize the pure friendship that we had worked so hard to form, but after that mistake I felt like everything has been ruined. 
 She told me about a week later that we should not do that again, since it will ruin what we had in the first place, but what she doesn't know is that I'm totally, and utterly into her. And whenever I try to drop the hints to her she simply shuts it out and mentions the fact that we're just friends.

AskReddit,cfr23ry,"In terms of easily understood moments that would radically alter the appearance of the modern world, the Battle of Tours in AD 732 is a pretty good candidate, at least by some reckonings. Charles Martel confronting Abd Al-Rahman Al Ghafiqi in battle in Central France has been characterized as the death blow to the Umayyad Caliphate's economic basis (the so-called ""ghanima economy""), and is seen by many as the moment at which the Muslim invasion of Christian Europe was halted. I shouldn't have to explain why this is a major, maybe even world-altering, event in history. 
 Now, real talk, there are historians who contest the importance of the battle; they tend to argue either that it was a minor raid by the Caliphate and fits into a pattern of the successful defense of European kingdoms against the invaders, or that regardless of the outcome of the battle the Muslim forces were pretty much at the end of their rope, already being incredibly far from secure territory. Whether or not Charles Martel deserves the title of ""Savior of Christendom"", however, this battle was still undeniably important, as it established the prominence of a family of Frankish noblemen who would subsequently come to be called the Carolingians. I shouldn't have to explain why that's important, either.","Charles Martel beats Abd Al-Rahman Al Ghafiqi and either sets the stage for the next 1000 years of both Muslim and Christian history, or Charles Martel Beats Abd Al-Rahman Al Ghafiqi and establishes the dynasty that would set the stage for the next 1000 years of both Muslim and Christian history.

 We shut off all the lights and I keep telling her scary stories.  She seems to be 'in the mood,' but I can't bang her with my friend in the closet, that would be waaaaaay too weird, though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted. 
 My other friend in the attic moves around making some noise above us, and naturally, she freaks out.  I say something like ""Its probably nothing, old house. Creaking floors and all that."" 
 She doesn't believe me, saying it sounds exactly like someone moving around. 
 I say ""it's probably just Loki, my dog.""  (She knows he died while I was young) 
 She says ""But Loki is dead!"" 
 And I was quiet for a little bit.  I'm sure that made her freak out even more.  Then I ask if she wants me to go check it out.  She tells me that it is  not  a good idea. 
 The guy in the closet turns the TV on with another remote I had programmed.  The TV turns on, its set to channel 4 with no antenna so only static is displayed.  I ask if she has the remote, she sees it on my desk and almost starts crying.  Shit.  She can't cry before the best part, that'd kill the joke.  I calm her down and say that its happened before, the house next door has the same remote and occasionally it happens.  I unplug the TV and say ""See, its all good now.  Kinda weird timing though and all that"" and I laugh.  She seems calmer. 
 My other friend, the dude in the attic, goes down into the basement and turns off the house's electricity.  Nothing turns off, as we were already in the dark. Then he calls us both using his and the other guy's cellphones, at the same time.  Our phones ring near simultaneously, she's pretty much lost it, no tears though, just scared, I think she begins to suspect something is up. 
 We both answer and it's just my friend breathing into the two phones.  Hearing the same thing at the same time on both the phones is gold.  She screams.  I calm her down and say ""Don't worry about its probably just Ross calling. (which it was heh)  I told him we were watching The Ring tonight and he probably thought it would be funny to call.  See, logical explanation for everything."" 
 ""I need to go to the bathroom""  I tell her.  My leaving was the signal for the guy to come out of the closet. 
 ""Don't go."" She tells me. 
 ""Don't be silly, I just need to go pee."" 
 But she won't let me go.  I joke and try to calm her down, but she won't let me go pee so the guy in the closet can come out.  We compromise, she comes to the bathroom with me.  I say ""Fine, but I'm still going to the bathroom."" 
 I go out into the bathroom and try to turn on the lights, it doesn't work. 
 She's very squeamish now, breathing weird, I'm getting worried that she might have a heart condition.  She lets me know that there was no storm today, no way the power could be out right now; I interrupt her and say ""Yeah, but stuff still happens, remember when the dude crashed his plane in Riverwest?  Its no big deal, you are waaaay too paranoid about stuff."" 
 We go back twoards my room, and my friend is standing in my bedroom, back facing us.  He turns around slowly, twitches, and cocks his head to the side. 
 She falls over screaming, crab walking backwards into the wall, and we all lose it laughing.  It was a fun night.

At least that was how I thought of it. It still is a habit of mine but I see everything in relation to that 8$ magic figure. Everything I eat to everything I see to everything I use and want. It's gotten better, only slightly, but i was a maniac for price tags after that... more than 8$? I didn't want it, I didn't even want to look at it... all I could think of was not letting my mother buy me things that were more than what i was worth. The few things I did want, I had them on a higher place in my mind than my own life. I was literally willing to die for my Dreamcast or my favourite books or anything worth more monetarily than myself since I figured, it would be worth more for my mom to sell it to at least make a profit on after I've died and wasn't there to use it anymore.

AskReddit,c25s9r7,"EDIT: I wrote this out on my iphone last night while laying in bed. Cleaning it up on my laptop to not make it look like such a mess and clarify some parts regarding police involvement or lack thereof. I know it sounds crazy but it's a fucked up world we live in. I'm sure anyone who has worked in hospitality at some point would also have some fucked up experiences to share. 
 One of my first jobs was cleaning rooms at a small town hotel. This happened almost five years ago... 
 The owners of the hotel also owned a small house which got rented to contractors working in town and we had to go and clean it too. The house was three bedroom with a hide-a-bed in the living room. This particular time four guys were staying in it that were in town for a few days. They kept the place clean and nothing was out of the ordinary, until they checked out... 
 Myself and a coworker were assigned to go and clean the house. When we entered I went to clean the two bedrooms and bathroom on the one side of the house and my coworker went to clean the kitchen, living room, and third bedroom. I finished the bathroom and one bedroom and moved on to the next bedroom, what I found will forever haunt my soul... 
 BLOOD AND SHIT EVERYWHERE, blankets, sheets and pillows strewn everywhere, bloody mattress, blood spots and bloody hand prints on the walls, dresser, nightstand, even the window and door. I yelled in surprise at the stench and sight of what appeared to be a murder scene without a body, my coworker ran over to see what happened and we both went to get our supervisor, we found no body and decided it wasn't a murder scene after phoning down to the office to briefly talk to our boss who said she would explain everything later if we just get the strip done now (we called the complete clean of a room after the people checked out a ""strip""). 
Supervisor helped me bag up the bloody laundry and load it into our work truck with the ruined mattress to be taken to the garbage dump. 
 While outside loading the truck with the supervisor the other girl stayed inside to finish cleaning the kitchen, she screamed from inside and ran out of the door yelling ""THERE'S SHIT ON IT!"". ""Shit on what?"" our supervisor replied, ""ON THE FUCKING FRYING PAN HANDLE!"" she then took off running across the lawn and down the street crying (exactly like Peter Griffin after the prostate exam) to tell our boss at the hotel of the events that unfolded. 
 My supervisor and I re-entered and disposed of the now infamous shitty frying pan which turns out was under the bed in the destroyed room. The remaining two of us finished disinfecting the house and many ""WHAT THE FUCKS"" were uttered between us as we moved around the room in what can only be described as a shell shocked state. After we finished we went down to the office back at the hotel for a meeting. 
 Turns out our boss (who was a real bitch who put on an overly cheerful facade), decided not to inform us of the state of the house before we were sent up to clean it. She had gone in earlier in the day to check over the room and then got the former occupants to explain themselves after phoning both their boss and local RCMP who didn't get involved as the victim didn't wish to press charges. It was a gay gang-rape or violent gang bang, whatever you want to call it, I call it ""rape"" because the recipient clearly suffered. The renters boss agreed to settle the large cleaning bill and were also banished from staying at the hotel in the future. The girl who ran off crying quit and my supervisor and I both got raises for staying. I have since moved on to a better job but the shitty frying pan has forever remained an inside joke amongst the staff at the hotel I used to work at.",had to clean up after a gay gang-rape that looked like a murder scene.
AskReddit,criijkq,"I'm a substitute teacher. Where I live, I need to be a fully certified teacher to be able to substitute, as such, substitute teachers by me are fully qualified teachers; they either just don't have a full time job yet or have retired and substitute to kill time, make a little extra cash, and stay in a classroom. 
 Now then, I also substitute in some schools in low income urban environments. When you teach full time, many teachers will tell you that the kids are the best part. It's a wonder and a joy to watch them learn and grow and form bonds with them. This is 200% true in almost all situations, barring exceptions; it's completely rewarding, if difficult and draining. When you're a substitute in a rough school, the kids are arguably the worst part. 
 In some of these worse off schools, students immediately stop acknowledging you as a human being; they will get up and walk around the room, throw shit, and pretty much do as you please and COMPLETELY ignore you if you try to tell them to do anything, and that's if your lucky. Generally at least one student a day will loudly insist that you aren't a real teacher, so they don't care (I am a real teacher goddamnit, I even adjunct a college course!). While they do everything in their power to bother you (up to and including openly insulting you and various obscenities I won't get into here) they will demand that you show them respect as an adult, and many kids will completely flip out if they perceive some slight, real or imagined. Students will lie about something, then when caught in the lie, be so obsessed with being insulted by the insinuation that they are dishonest, they will get in a fist fight knowing they were wrong in the first place. 
 Many will proclaim that the work you give them is just busy work and it doesn't matter... the worst part is that 2/3 times they are right about it being busy work, but you just gotta grin and bear it. 
 A substitute has no power. I can hardly follow through on discipline besides calling security or the main office, or leaving their real teacher a note. In some schools the main office and security are huge support systems and none of these issues are major problems. In some schools you arrive for class and the kids just quietly do their work and chat amongst themselves and you have an amazing day. In other schools they shrug when you tell them the kids have stolen items from the teachers desk to play catch with, and just say that's how kids are. 
 I've had kids walk out of my room in the middle of class and high five the security guard while I proclaim they are cutting class and the guard laughs. I've had kids get in fights while a dean is in the room with me, and I've had kids tell me and the Dean to go fuck ourselves and receive no punishment. I've had a girl stand on all fours on her desk and announce that she will refuse to speak to anyone, many of these incidents days before a state test or regents exam that the teacher is emphatically concerned about preparing them for. 
 I'd say a close second place for worst thing about subbing is not knowing when you work. You go to bed hoping you'll have a Job and are violently awoken at 5:30 AM with a phone call asking if you can come in.","kids can be demons, and waking up super early by a phone call sucks."
AskReddit,c5se45v,"I hope at least a handful of people see this. Not my story, but it amazes me. 
 My grandparents live in Arizona and have a very tight knit group of friends. I use to go out there for the summer and I loved each and everyone of those people. However, they are old and things happen, sadly. One day, a friend of theirs, Jerry, needed to get some sort of heart surgery. I don't exactly remember why. 
 My grandparents went to Vegas with Jerry and his wife, Patty, to support the both of them. (Their town is small-ish so air-lifting to Vegas happens often. They all prefer it to phoenix.) 
 Jerry and Patty had a little shih tzu named Max. He wasn't young, just tiny. My uncle, who lived in the same house as my grandparents, was watching Max overnight until they got home. 
 Max was a quiet dog. Usually just waddled around sniffing things. Didn't bark at strangers or get terribly aggressive or uppidy about things. He was a chill little dude. 
 However, that night, Max started to lose his shit. It was about 3 AM when the dog ran to the back door, scratching at it and barking and going crazy. My Uncle, being a night-owl, was still awake, and thought maybe there was an animal outside. He grabbed a bat, turned the deck lights on, and walked around the property. Nothing. He shrugged it off and went back inside, taking Max into his room. 
 Max continued to bark and scratch at my uncles bedroom door, forcing him to let him out into the rest of the house. This went on almost consistently for 2-3 hours. 
 When it stopped, it was abrupt. The dog sort of stared at the backdoor, ears all perked up, and got really quiet. He waddled back into my uncles bedroom, laid down, and slept for the rest of the night. 
 Upon telling my Grandma about this the next day, my uncle was pretty shocked when he found out what was the cause of the dogs commotion. Jerry went into surgery at 3 AM. And got out a couple hours later. 
 The dog didn't save his life or anything, but it really amazes me that dogs know these sort of things. Sad to say, Max passed a couple years ago from a coyote incident. :/","Usually quiet dog loses it's shit while it's owner is in surgery a state away, then calms down when the surgery is over.

AskReddit,cqykd1n,"Finally! I can tell this story!! 
 Ok. So I'm on about a 2 hour flight from I think Florida to Chicago. I get an aisle seat on this overbooked flight. We take off, all is well, and I pull up my tablet and start watching a movie. To my diagonal right (to my right and one seat up) in the opposite aisle seat, a woman probably about 18-20 years old, boots up her laptop and begins typing in a word document. I don't think anything of it; she's probably doing homework. 
 About half way through the movie I'm watching (Gamer with Gerard Butler) I suddenly remember seconds before it happens that there are BOOBS in this movie (the part where Simon is video chatting with the twins  do you want to see our tits Simon?  yeah that part) 
 So I shut off my movie, as not to freak out anyone around me. Boredom ensues. So I start reading what the woman diagonally from me is writing. 
 Good lord. The gist of it was, I'm not 100% sure if she was trying to write a fictional novel or if she was writing a diary kind of entry about her life. Basically, the story went on about how some guy had given her crabs (i.e STD/pubic lice). She wrote things like: 
 ""I was trying so hard not to itch my vagina. It burned and itched so fucking bad.""  something like that.
She goes on to talk about how her friend tried to bring it up to her but she denied it (lying obviously) and she ended up confronting the guy who gave it to her and he also denied it.

When he finally got to his house he pulled into his driveway, turned off the car engine, stepped out of the vehicle then proceeded to chug a couple bottles of NyQuil. He told the cops that he was sick (hence the NyQuil) and had his radio on so he couldn't hear the sirens and didn't notice the lights behind. They couldn't bust him on a DUI charge because they couldn't prove that the alcohol in his system was from drinking or the bottles of NyQuil that he downed. He did get arrested and spent the night in jail but during his case all of the charges were dropped.","Keep a few bottles of NyQuil in your car and if you're drunk and close to home, don't pull over.

AskReddit,ccrpaz9,"Ill copy paste this from a previous time I posted this 
 I decided ill let you enjoy my story of last saturday aswell So basicly last night was a nightmare: I was just staying at my own place didnt go out or anything. So i got bored and decided i was going to use some xtc. the dose i took was rather high normally you want a around 180-220mg in total to have a good trip/experience i took around 700 in total. 
 So all was fine at first i was just watching this movie and all of the sudden the effects kick in and im like im gonna turn on a pandora station and im gonna lay in my bed just chill/relaxed then i hear my headphones starting to stutter like strange noises and shit 
 I look up and i see this person putting his head up from behind my desk I swear i was convinced he was 100% real. I just stared at him for a good 30 sec before i told him to fuck off and get lost. He put his head back down and i didnt think much of it. 
 So i go back to laying my head on my pillow when all the sudden i notice this creepy fucking hand next to my head. So i get the fuck up and see him laying next to me with this creepy horror face and smile. Then he vanishes in thin air until i feel a drop on my head and i look up there is this big puddle of blood on the ceiling and i see him smiling again with bloody theeth. I was like wtf so i closed my eyes for a few seconds and it was gone again. So next thing i know i see him again from across my bedroom running towards me screaming and shit and he vanishes right before he would of ran into me. Only this time i can see him moving around when he was invisible and i can see this kind of electric cloud moving around the room like very blury almost like you can still see for example harry potter with his invisibility cloak on. 
 Strange part also was that i could kinda feel him. and if i touched his invisible body for too long it would start to hurt like hell. so he keeps popping up at random places and tries to scare/haunt the shit out of me screaming biting and hitting.
After a while he was gone and then other strange shit started to happen like i started seeing a bunch of cats in my closet at first it was 1 but soon there were many more that was kinda freaky because i would get up from my bed and see them until i moved super close and tried touching them then they dissapeared.
After that i saw a ton of people i know and i had tons of conversations with them but everytime something seemed a bit off so i was kinda curious and i asked them why they were acting this way and after i said that this guy that i work for looked me in the eye and said: Who do you think you are talking too?! 
 I blinked and he changed into the horror person from before again smiling and smirking and just doing random shit he vanishes again and after that i was probably laying on my bed for another hour or so
My bed was super wet aswell at this point because if you take xtc you start sweating like a madman so that was kinda nasty.
so after he last dissapeard i was feeling chill and what not but i dropped my phone. I kinda lay down so i can grab my phone that fell underneath my bed and there i saw the person for the last time he tried to bite my hand or something so i pulled my hand back flipped the bed over but he was gone. 
 After about 2-3 more hours i finally got to sleep and woke up.
Been having small panic attacks ever since and I am now unable to sleep with the lights off (its been rougly 6weeks) And i just got diagnosed with HPPD. I also keep seeing shadowpeople everywere and they continue to haunt me (google shadow people if you dont know what they are, Alot of people see the same things I have seen and am still seeing) 
 Before anyone says it is not possible to hallucinate on xtc note and read this: 
MDMA can induce euphoria, a sense of intimacy with others, diminished anxiety, and mild psychedelia The following subjective effects of MDMA were statistically significant in a placebo-controlled trial, using Altered States of Consciousness rating scale: derealization, depersonalization, altered perception of space and time, positive basic mood, mania-like experience, anxious derealization, thought disorder, fears of loss of thought or body control, visual hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations, synesthesia, changed meaning of percepts, facilitated recollection or imagination. On an Adjective Mood rating scale, the following measurements were significantly increased: self-confidence, heightened mood, apprehension-anxiety, thoughtfulness-contemplativeness, extroversion, dazed state, sensitivity and emotional excitation Please note: mild psychedelia, altered perception of space and time, mania-like experience and the most important visual hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations source:  Also I looked on a dutch website (www.drugsforum.info) and I read about whenever you take xtc/mdma some of it gets converted into MDA and that causes you to hallucinate so basicly if you take a rather high amount of XTC the more MDMA gets converted into MDA thus the more likely you are to hallucinate..
Also please note that the dose I took was really high I also did not drink any water at all (the dose and the lack of hydration has been known to kill people) 
 Also if you do not believe me google for mdma hallucinations.",took a high dose of Xtc and got some very vivid hallucinations
AskReddit,c3wojh4,"Happened last night actually. 
 It was my first time to smoke DMT, i was really nervous and anxious about what was gonna happen, and what i was gonna be shown. There were 5 of us. We walked around with a friend looking for the perfect spot outside surrounded by nature to enjoy our blast off. 
 We finally settled on a spot, layed down a blanket, took our shoes off, and emptied out pockets. We sat cross legged, each one of us were like the point on a star. I was the third of 5 to smoke, i took a few hits, closed my eyes, and sat the pipe down. I can feel it bearly touching my senses, i kept asking myself, and asking myself if i should take another hit, something said 'Yeah, take another hit'. 
 I took another big hit, and held my breathe, here it is, beautiful shapes and colors like nothing i had seen. I opened my eyes and it was a whole new world. Like everything was re-skinned to look like a checkerboard color by numbers. And i was apart of the scenery, i could feel light shooting through my body. My eyes opened so wide, and i just said WOW thank you, over and over. I could see a holographhic image of my face infront of me, and a spot of pure white light coming from between my eyes, where my third eye would be. It felt like she had blown me a kiss, and with the air she blew the colors would change a little. It felt like she was super playful and innocent, but she knew what she was doing. After she blew me a kiss she playfully ran away. 
 Even after coming down, i was so thankful, and still saying thank you, cause i knew she was there looking and watching. 
 I was so fucking happy, im still happy. Everytime i think about it, i get a big grin on my face, and i just feel sooo good. Im getting goosebumps thinkin about.","Thank you for DMT, I cant thank you enough. Im soo grateful, thank you again."

AskReddit,c3i66ar,"You don't. I lost my younger sister three years ago to complications from Lupus. She suffered horribly. Her fingers were rotting off and she had calciphylaxis. She was in terrible pain the last year of her life, and spent most of it in a hospital under a lot of painkillers. When she wasn't on them I could hear her moaning and wailing in the background. I live in another state from her and was (still am) very poor at the time so travel, or staying down there just wasn't an option. I tried to talk to her, and my family on the phone as much as possible while she was sick to check on her, and my family. I'd crack jokes to her and try to make her laugh. 
 I say this because at least in my situation there was a mix of relief that she was no longer suffering, and a crippling grief that she was no longer here. Multiply that with the guilt form the fact that I was not there when she died and I felt awful. I would dream about her every night for a month, on the nights that I would sleep, and the dreams would wake me up and I couldn't rest any more. I felt numb for a long time, and I kept trying to psych myself out of it (antidepressants helped). But I also came to the realization that she would not want me to wallow in grief, and that her death taught me what precious little time there is to live, and that I shouldn't waste it on what ifs and pointless wallowing. 
 I'm not saying don't feel bad. You will. It was a strong network of friends that I kept filled in on details, and their humor and mine that kept me functioning. Allow yourself to feel all of these things. I remember in the eulogy, I talked about how we were all still in shock that the dance was over leaving us wanting more, and I think that's what it is. You regret there won't be any more time, more experiences to share with her. 
 Hopefully your family has a strong support structure, playing grief counselor to my mom was the worst. I hope you don't have to do that. And hang onto whatever you can of hers, to look back on. I still have all the birthday cards she sent me. They give me a good cry when sorting through them, and I can still her her laugh when I'm reading them. Which is a good thing.

 > You're assuming the man wants a birth to occur. So if this is the case, then the women should be forced to bear all the responsibility since she's the one who CHOSE to have the kid. 
 If the man doesn't want the birth, he should wear a condom. If he doesn't, then he's risking conception and should bear the responsibility. That said, I'm not naïve; I'm well aware that a woman may argue that she is using another contraceptive, and either genuinely forget to maintain said method (in the case of pills, etc.), or may actually be lying. I view these acts the same as a man saying he'll pull out, or that he's sterile; accidents should be a mitigating factor in disputes over birth rights, and fraudulent claims should be a criminal offence. However, the law shouldn't pander to stupidity, and sexytimes without a wrapper is stupid, and you have to be prepared for the consequences. 
 > Unless your argument is now that women shouldn't be allowed to have an abortion? 
 I'm about to lose a lot of comment karma for this, but here goes; 
 Her decision should not be the only determining factor. 
 I'm not talking about tying a woman down and force-feeding her until her baby comes to term; FORCING a woman to have a baby is not an option, and I don't want anyone to misconstrue my arguments as for that. 
 However, making the fetus is a mutual decision, unmaking it should be as well. Since the pregnancy is obviously of a medical concern only to the mother, the father should have significant burden to make case for the continuance of pregnancy. The father should be required to file a legal document, a notice of intent to parent. He should prove he has the means to care for not only the baby, but for the medical needs of the mother as related to the pregnancy. 
 Once that's been established, the woman is then legally liable for an abortion. She is not prevented from getting one, but some recompense to the father of the baby must be made if she decides to abort. 
 Obviously, mitigating circumstances should be taken into account, including the age of both parties, the legal status of conception (As mentioned; rape throws it all out the window, and fraud should be considered.), and paramount to all, the medical needs of the mother.","A woman should not be allowed to abort a consensually conceived child from a still-willing and proven able father without facing liability to the father for the lost child, unless in cases where medical need is established."
AskReddit,c25ydi0,"I was pulled out of my car by six supposed police officers (none would show ID) in January. Broke the window of the car, forced the door open, and pulled us out. As soon as I was out of the car, they threw me on the ground and tried to say I was resisting arrest (asking them if you can assist them further in not resisting == avoided resisting arrest charge). spent 7 hours in the police station while multiple officers called me ""faggot"", and ""lard ass"". They tried to strip search me (which failed when I questioned the officer's sexuality). For most of my visit at the station, I was put in a room with a gigantic subwoofer, that played music at levels that permanently damaged my hearing. Eventually, I was forced to sign a promise to appear (for 3 months later), or they'd keep abusing me. 
 The funny part? before breaking the car window, they were given a copy of my Fee Schedule, and they agreed to all charges on it.

 In February he messaged me as I had shown up in his search results. I read his message and didn't reply. A few days later it got the better of me so I sent him a message and soon found out we had a lot in common. Namely, being a vegetarian and WoW. 
 He gave me his phone number and I texted him. We set up a time to play WoW... 
 We played low level horde characters and chatted on vent. I thought this guy is pretty cool, but no, I am about to go travelling. He then spent money and transferred his main character and we started raiding together. 
 He knew I was going travelling very soon but we organised to meet and have some fun around Sydney as he was new to the state. We met at 10am, and I thought jeez this guy is tall. We did stupid things like go to the museum, eat chinese food, walk around Circular Quay. Since I was saving to go OS and he was a student, we were cheapies so got a bottle of wine and sat in the Sydney Botanical Gardens drinking and watching the boats leave the harbour.

He then waved a slip of paper through the no flame zone to show it did not put out the flame or burn the paper.

AskReddit,c2c397m,"As a kid, I owned a beautiful pair of Bauer quad skates. I loved them. Together, we could do anything; and often would. In Bristol, where I lived at the time, there was a hill. It was called Channell's Hill. It should have been named Channell's Mountain, and perhaps at one time it was. 
 This hill was feared by my fellow quadians, as the speed you built up by the half way mark was easily over 30 MPH, if you had good bearings in your wheels. I had Mach 5's, which is skate talk for 'my face is peeling off'. 
 Anyways, I decide that Channel's Hill is going to be my bitch; and with no regard for my own personal safety; start to roll down it. The pick up of speed was exhilarating to say the least. I started to realise that the smallest movement of either one of my feet in either direction would cause me to be pasted all over the road and the fear focused me utterly on my goal. 
 By the half way mark, I feel as though I can see time, and taste colours. I am acutely aware that this hill was not meant to be challenged by man, and that I was a fool to embark upon such a quest. As I am mentally completing my last will and testament, a car appears from around the corner at the bottom of the hill. 
 This presents me with a problem. Zeus himself could not stop me now; let alone the crappy rubber stopper on the back of my right quad. Along for the ride, was the fact that Channel's Hill is barely wide enough for one car. Completely and utterly fixed on my trajectory; the only thing left to do was turn the car into a moving, 30 MPH ramp. 
 And so, without really putting too much thought into it; I jumped. I hit the front of the car HARD, and then shot up the windscreen like a bullet from a gun. Never in my life; before then, or since; have I been that high in the sky without a plane. 
 What felt like hours but must have been all of 5 seconds passed before I landed. Somehow; I managed to land squarely on both feet. Unfortunately, for reasons known only to them; the kind folks at Bauer had not safety tested their quad boots to withstand landings from what felt like 100 feet in the air. My trucks exploded, and my skates went in approximately 752,000 different directions at once. I had but one direction to travel in, and that was down. 
 I believe I set a rolling on tarmac world record that day; and when I finally stopped rolling, I can vividly remember that despite my clothes being in tatters, and my boots now nothing but moulded plastic slippers; my sunglasses were still perched atop my head. 
 I sat in the middle of the road and laughed hysterically for far too long; doubtlessly enjoying shock, and the glorious natural high that it brings. 
 Funnily enough, the driver of the car never stopped; nor was my accident ever reported to the police. They believed that the car was stolen, due to the fact that the car had been going the wrong way up a one way hill.

 2 management is well adjusted to not giving a shit about the personal lives of humans.

AskReddit,c0rr3vh,"This post is a great demonstration of a misguided and often belligerent line of thinking that, if not inherent to American-flavored libertarianism, is often correlated with it. It's an obsession with blaming others, and ironically very often blaming them for blaming others. 
 People in this camp like to say that everything that happens to people is a result of personal choices. And, since they made the choice, or were not strong-willed enough to make the right choice, they can be criticized for it. 
 We wouldn't mock people for immutable characteristics (race, having down's syndrome) but anything they choose to do (a wild hairstyle or getting bad grades) is fair game. Fair game for being either a punching bag or being told that they don't deserve to help from others, and that the only help that's acceptable is the cold kind: internet, books, and perhaps some kind of non-profit meeting in a church basement. 
 This post, by dismissing  out of hand  genetic or other unalterable causes for obesity, unfairly shifts the discussion to whether advertising is pervasive or cheap gym memberships are available. 
 I'm sorry, but it's not enough of a justification to hearken back to the good old days when everyone was a rugged frontiersman and had the maximum personal responsibility and just dismiss the science nobody understood back then. 
 What's more, this obsession with ""personal responsibility"" ironically resembles its targets. Saying ""Fat people need to take the blame for being fat"" is little different from the fat person who actually does try to blame society.

AskReddit,ci68qop,"This happened in my senior year of high school. 
 I had the hots for a guy who didn't return the feelings.  I asked him to senior prom; he laughed and said something to the effect of not a chance in hell. 
 Best girl friend witnessed this, and said she would fix it.  She asked if I would be willing to go on a blind date to our prom.  Seeing as how I had no other real options, I said sure.  On the big day, she loaned me a dress, and helped me out with the makeup.  I asked her when I was going to find out who the mystery date was and she assured me that I knew him (small town) and that he was having transportation problems and would meet me at the prom itself. 
 I thought it was weird, but okay.  I asked her when she was going to get herself ready, and she made some lame excuse about not wanting to go, it being my big night, something like that.  A while later she and another friend dropped me at the prom and I said, okay, I need to know who I'm looking for and she said it's Jason! Jason's going to be here and be your date. 
 Okay.  I was okay with Jason.  Certainly not a dreamboat but neither was I.  I had the boutineer (spelling? the little flower thing anyway). So I went into the prom and waited.  And waited.  The guy I had the hots for showed up with some other girl and sat at the same table I was at.  I pretended to not look like I was impatient.  I waited and waited.  And waited. Eventually, Jason showed up at like 9:30, with  another girl**, from the 10th grade no less. 
 To say I was angry was an understatement.  I got up and tried to confront him.  I ended up throwing the flowery thing at him and storming off.  He caught up with me and asked me what I was angry about.  I told him I thought he was going to be my blind date for the prom and he said, yeah, you were for like a week, and then the other girl needed a date, so I told (best friend) that I couldn't do the blind date with you anymore and she was supposed to tell you. 
 So essentially, my best friend set me up with a blind date who had cancelled at least a week in advance and sent me off to prom to be blindsided AT the prom.

 I took my car in for an oil change an alignment. They called me out and told me I needed a $3,000 repair to my steering system. 
 What they showed me was that the wheel was wobbling, and said it was due to several damaged parts. They also told me that there was obviuosly a crack because there was steering fluid visible. They then said ""Of course you know this because you've been topping it off."" 
 That's when I started to wonder. I said ""I have never topped it off."" They then said ""Well, someone  has."" I asked how they knew and they said it was over filled. That's when I pointed out I live alone, and as I was in for an oil change nobody had even been in a position to do that for 6 months, but they insisted someone was topping off my steering fluid regularly. I finally asked ""So you're saying the Steering Fluid Fairy is topping off my car?"" 
 They didn't much care for that and since they couldn't show me a crack and it was driveable I said I wanted a second opinion. 
 I started by seeing what the repairs should cost. I found their quote for parts was more than twice what I could get the parts for, without even talking about labor. I found another mechanic who would do the labor piece for $200, so I knew I could get it fixed for less than a third of their quote. 
 I then asked the mechanic I found to do me a favor and do an inspection so I knew exactly what parts to buy and he agreed to do it for $25.

AskReddit,cclaox8,"I've worked in lots of places as a nurse by night, and have seen so many different unexplainable and creepy things. Especially when working in places where there are a lot of people at the end of their lives. Night time seems to see the most deaths and oftentimes unexplained happenings occur when there's been a death. 
 This is probably going to be long, but the creepiest and scariest thing I've ever seen happened on a nightshift around 13 years ago when I worked nights in what was known then as an EMI unit - a nursing home for the elderly mentally ill. Mostly dementia, alzheimers, burned out schizophrenics, ex-alcoholic people with brain damage and that sort of thing. There were 47 beds and all full at the time. 
 The home had beds on the ground floor that was reserved for the dying and upstairs was for people with better mobility who could access a lift. There were some central stairs that staff used, but they were locked at the top for safety. The whole place was built in such a way that the stairs were visible from all the communal areas. Nobody could come down or go up unseen. 
 This one night after every last resident was in bed, me and the other three staff had finished up the cleaning and were sat in the living area having a cup of tea and a chat before we started our rounds. The living area had a large opening in the wall that connected to the kitchen area. The kitchen was still lit up and we were sat facing the opening talking inane crap... work related politics; what we did on our days off etc. 
 All of a sudden, the door on the far end of the kitchen flung open and all we could see was the figure of a man but all that was visible was the arm, shoulder and left leg. He was holding into the door before slamming it shut. We jumped up and checked all the rooms.. everyone was sleeping. 
 It couldn't have been a resident as nobody had come down the stairs and everyone downstairs was unable to walk and in the last days of their lives. We were all baffled by who the f##ing hell was THAT? The figure had been wearing the typical nursing home standard style pyjamas but the fact there was no head or right side of the body was pretty sickening. I thought perhaps it was just me who had seen it from a funny angle but the other three staff members confirmed the same. No head..just left arm, shoulder and leg. 
 Nobody could explain who or what it was. Collective hallucination? Or the Ghost or energy of a former resident? Who knows. Just thinking of it makes my stomach flip to this day.","Saw a creepy half man with no head fling a door open in a nursing home during a nightshift.

So of course, one of our favourite things to do when our mom was busy somewhere in the house was to jump across from bed to bed . Mom tells us not to do it all the time since it's super dangerous, we still do of course because we are dumb kids. One day she's baking and tells us we will be in  super trouble  if we jump across the beds, we do it anyway, brother get bored and leaves, I'm still jumping back and forth - hear her call my name - sheer panic midair, I try to turn and explain, end up missing the bed and smashing into the windowsill that my brother's bed is pushed against.

AskReddit,c5tdqvw,"I agree with OP. I think a bigger emphasis on vocational training would be nice: teaching students real-world skills that tie in with established subjects instead of forcing rote memorization of largely useless information. For instance, learn to do taxes/organize a budget in math class, or how to write a cover letter in English. 
 This will probably get me downvoted, but I also think that home economics should be mandatory, and that it should teach things like basic cooking, sewing, financial skills, sex ed and hygiene (washing clothes etc). I know that a lot of people will either say that's stupid or that those are the things parents teach their kids, but unfortunately there are a lot of people out there who don't know the first thing about cooking a simple/healthy meal, or doing a load of laundry, or keeping a budget. There's a serious lack of basic life skills being passed down right now, and it wouldn't hurt for schools to teach some of these things alongside history and calculus and whatever else.","Teach kids how to do their taxes, feed themselves, and properly manage their genitals, because odds are they're going to need that information in the future."

AskReddit,cdp7k2x,"so I was raised by my mom my whole life. I know my dad and see him every now and then, but he's never been a huge part of my life.  I have his last name not my mom's, which isn't really all that uncommon these days, but growing up I always wondered why I me and my mom had different last names. As I got older, my mom's answers changed. First, it was ""well your dad wanted to be a part of your life."" Then when that proved untrue, ""children usually have their father's name,"" etc. Now around the same age I was trying to figure this out (like 8ish), I learned that my grandpa on my mom's side wasn't my biological grandpa. Turns out my mom's parents got divorced when she was young and my ""grandpa"" was actually the man my grandma's been dating for 20 or so years. My mom never really wanted to talk about who my real grandpa, her dad, was and I eventually learned not to ask. 
 When I was like 16 or 17, I finally got the whole story. Turns out my mom gave me my dad's last name because her father was schizophrenic and physically/sexually abusive. She didn't want me to carry his name and possibly be tracked down by him, so she gave me my dad's name even though she knew he wouldn't have a major role in my life. We're not listed in the phonebook for the same reason.

 (1) My girlfriend dumped me one month prior, and I was not able to find a date in time for the prom. I was a huge spaz, nerd, socially incompetent. 
 (2) My main friends all had girlfriends/boyfriends at a nearby school. So instead of going to our school's prom, they are out at another school's senior prom. 
(3) All the people I hate are there. THe people who've spent the past four years teasing me, insulting me, stuffing me in lockers, pelting me with milk cartons. I am alone. None of my friends are there. Luckily, they are generally preoccupied with their dates. I am alone, with little to do. 
(3)  IT'S ON A BOAT. Said boat goes out beyond the Golden Gate bridge, towards the Farallon's. Cramped, and it's a bitterly cold night. 
  (4) THE DJ Sucks. I'm a musical individual, a radio DJ (KVHS at the time), and this guy is playing dreck. Utter dreck. Lots of country, Garth Brooks, bad hip hop. This is 1997. Closest thing to a rock song is 'Pop' by U2. It is torture for me. 
(5) THE BUFFET HAD FOOD POISONING. So around 9PM or so, lot's of people start getting sick. Puking, pooping. There's a very limited amount of bathrooms. Guys start pissing over the railings just to avoid the stench of the men's room. The bathrooms are soon the most crowded part of the prom. Luckily for myself, I ate before the prom, skipped out on getting sick myself. 
(6) THE BOAT BROKE DOWN. We lost drive power but not engine power, so we had electricals- but the boat was just afloat, off the Bay area, somewhere around Marin County.

 Travel light. Remember it can be some distance between stations and hostels/sights. I used to see p ** d off backpackers every day with bags that were overloaded with crap they didn't need. It makes them miserable and stops them enjoying everything that's around them 
 
 If you're staying in hostels, be nice to the staff. Make a joke, don't get stroppy if everything isn't as you expected. They're on low pay and work long hours, but if you make friends with them they'll show you the cool sights and probably give you some cheap beer at the bar! 
 
 Have fun and take everything chance you're given. The chances are you won't be back to these places so enjoy them whilst you're there. My rule is to never say no. Read into that what you want! 
 
 European trains are, on the whole, very safe and efficient. The staff are usually multi-lingual and you get to see lots from the windows. If you're taking a long journey, pack food, water and booze. 
 
 Wherever you are: talk to people. Find out about their cultures, what's fun to do in their city and learn some of the language from them.

AskReddit,cdthtuu,"Actually it's a process that is usually shorter. Mostly it's the validity that the money isn't meant for illegal purposes. Particularly the bitcoin phenomenon and black markets. 
 When you click ""Submit"" a lot of things happen instantly. 
 
 Money is put into pending 
 Amount is declared from paypal 
 Bank system notified that transfer is incoming 
 Pend against bank system to ensure account is active or available for transfer 
 Bank system returns result to paypal 
 
 Usually these happen instantly. However there is a system monitoring this on both sides. If either of the systems disagree then the hold is available to be evaluated by the side that terminated the transfer. 
 The time mechanism is in place for these instances. It's not a button pushing event to transfer money in those circumstances. There is usually some sort of ""reliable transfer"" information that needs to be acquired. For instance: 
 
 I did work for Freelancer website 
 I get paid to paypal 
 Money is ready for transfer to bank account and I hit ""Transfer"" 
 Fee's declared from paypal on behalf of Gov't/Paypal/Bank 
 I accept these 
 Receipt is produced and money begins to pend 
 Bank system verifies that the money is available and account is able to recieve 
 
 If anything fails in this timeline then the time period is applicable. Otherwise it gives the bank system and paypal system a long enough time to sort out if the money/account is not only viable, but also not declared stolen from sender etc. 
 Otherwise it is instant, even if you don't see it. My bank does a pending allowance. If money is pended and the source is trustworthy, like Direct deposit from a company I work for, or paypal and so on it allows me to use that money.

AskReddit,c82radu,"I worked for a company in Lincoln, NE that serviced business aircraft for a while in the late 90s.  The duties in my first position there included driving around in the afternoon to places around town and picking up various items on purchase orders, dropping off other items...basically errand guy.  One time I'm in the Haymarket area (old warehouses etc, revitalized back in the 80s), parked the van under an overpass and dropped off an item.  I come back to the van and there was a DEAD, BLOATED ROOSTER right behind the tire of the van.  I didn't drive over it while parking - I would have felt that.  No tire tracks on the body, nothing.  It had obviously been dead for a while - it wasn't smelly or decomposing, but that wasn't too far off.  I was sure I was a victim of a prank or something.  I looked around and didn't see anybody, didn't hear anybody.  I had some gloves with me, so I put them on, grabbed the feet and pulled it just far enough so the tire wouldn't hit the bird on the way out.  I left...wondering WTF had just happened.","Found dead rooster under work van, no idea how it got there"

AskReddit,c3fk9uf,"I once dreamed that I became a prominent physicist and researcher, was contracted by the government to do work on a suspicious project, then ignored my misgivings and went ahead (because the money was so good). Years later, the human race made first contact with a race of sentient, primate-like extraterrestrial beings thanks in no small part to space travel advances that I had contributed to. Meanwhile, I met a wonderful girl, dated her blissfully for years, and married her, all against the backdrop of humanity's developing relationship with the outsiders. 
 Soon, it became a matter of public knowledge that the other beings' native planet was rich with some sort of resource that we desperately needed, or at least our leaders felt that we did. As diplomatic relations deteriorated rapidly, riots broke out in major cities and violence was widespread. My wife didn't take the state of affairs well; her mental health began to decline. I didn't notice. My superiors were demanding more and more work from me. This new research seemed conspicuously militaristic, but I felt trapped--to far in to stop now. 
 The military, amid a flood of human nationalism and aggressive public sentiment, suddenly unveiled a terrifying display of new weapon technology, far beyond anything we'd ever seen in human history and vastly exceeding the extraterrestrial beings' technological capacity. Their meager remaining population on Earth was quickly wiped out, and genocide on a global scale on their home planet soon followed. 
 My research, from the beginning, had been the single most important factor in the development of this terrible new weaponry. I came home one night to find my wife had shot herself in our kitchen, disgusted with herself, her husband, and humanity. I stared for a few minutes, and then ended my own life.

AskReddit,c63bm97,"Forgivness is a powerful thing for yourself. You seem to still be carrying a lot of that hate and pain in your heart and it will be hard to get your life on track with that burden. So you made bad decisions and are stuck working a god awful job? So what, you think you're special? EVERYONE has been suffering in this economy, it's just a matter of degree. I've been working shit jobs with illegal immigrants much of the last four years to just barely make ends meet and dig myself deeper into credit card debt. I get that hopeless feeling that I'm sure you suffer from and I know how hard it is. It's a bit of mental framing, instead of 'this bitch crushed my life and sent me off to this hellhole', you need to view it as,'this is hardening my resolve to persevere through anything.' When you come back, you'll know in your marrow what you are truly made out of. Jake and Elwood were right, the lord works in mysterious ways. 
 I had a girl crush my heart on two separate occasions because I'm a moron for going back to the well again. The second time happened just before I got incredibly ill while working as a EMT. My stomach was shot to shit so badly that I couldn't eat solid foods all shift and I was in constant terror of having a shitticane attack in the middle of an emergency call. There were a number of factors that contributed to this and her cunty behavior (and more likely the heavy drinking i engaged in to dull the pain) were a factor. I am just now getting my life together and taking authoity over my life almost two years after my heartbreak. But I forgave her a long ago because you cannot blame one person for all thr troubles in my life. You recognize that but I'm not sure you understand the depth of it with your flippant 'i was the one chasing the poon' response (unless you're like me and just like humorous turns of phrase. It's hard to know you or the situation with the limited details of the story). It sucks that this is happening so quickly and you don't have the time or perspective to see this because I am certain you will eventually. I just hope its not too late. 
 My advice is to speak with her more. There is nothing wrong with your brief reply but it does nothing positive for anyone. You have this pain inside you and being a cold asshole won't make that go away. Ask questions and demand answers. Don't just let her off the hook because she's dying but show some heart. If she is as cold and callus as you make her out to be, you are not the only one she hurt. By digging deeper and learning why things played out the way they did might give her some insight before she passes and that will help her make amends with others who were hurt. You'll also be giving the wonderful gift of helping ease a dying woman's pain in her last few days. If she is genuine, I really think she will appreciate your help in relieving the burden from her spirit. And if she's not genuine, then the forgiveness will be all for you, which is the most important part. Letting go of that hate and anger will help you feel less like a victim and take authority over your life again. You're on the hero's quest brother. You've entered the darkened woods and you'll encounter all sorts trials but you will come out with the Holy Grail. You can't make itnout unscathed with that burden inside you",life is hard brother. Forgiveness will give you clarity and take a tremendous burden off of you.

There was this time (I was 7 years old) when two guys came to me and brought me to their friend who was sitting in a pile of snow, as on a throne. They asked me to get on my knees, I did, and the guy in question began to ask me if I wanted to become ""his queen"" in a very serious way (long speech, too). I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. It was awkward. 
 The other (I was 13 years old) start like this: A guy (15 years old) asked my e-mail adress to my friends and sent me a long message about how much he loved me and how much he wanted me to go out with him.

AskReddit,c4ogq35,"Although I have no expertise on the area, other than being a storm chaser myself, I would have to say yes.  With all the debris that you are speaking of, people just have the mindset that tornadoes only happen in cities.  I think that's because of the mass media coverage when they do.  In fact, a very small number of tornadoes occur in cities and even fewer kill people.  So now to be sucked up into a tornado, we're talking a fairly large tornado (EF2 or EF3).  Place that out in the middle of a dirt field or farm, where most tornadoes occur.  I would have to say with most certainly, when you remove the debris from the tornado, somebody could survive getting 'sucked up' and thrown a reasonable distance.  The most damaging factor of the tornado would be getting slammed back to the ground after the initial launch and then likely dragged across the ground a fair distance.

 I was there, too.  I was very withdrawn in junior high and high school.  Didn't talk to a lot of people, was the person who was easily forgotten or worse, the target of ridicule.  But I got tired of that.  I wanted friends, I wanted to be recognized, so I put effort into it.  And that sucked, hard.  I failed a lot.

AskReddit,c7ookn7,"Hi, scientist here! Science does not prove what it/they (the scientists) set out to prove. This happened to me in November-I had a hypothesis about a given phenomenon, and set out to prove my hypothesis correct (fuck you, null hypotheses!). My hypothesis was not correct, and I essentially proved the opposite of what I set out to do. I made a new hypothesis and did new experiments. Now I have an answer, and probably the explanation for the phenomenon I saw. 
 This happens all the time in science. Scientists are investigating numerous potential reasons for the universes creation-you only hear about the one that currently fits our world the best. If new evidence came to light tomorrow that disproved the big bang theory, a new theory would take its place. Want proof? Check out the Bohr model of the atom-it was the generally accepted model of atomic structure. It was proven wrong within Bohr's lifetime, and the accepted model changed. 
 I think that neither religion nor science ""proves"" anything. Religion demands mindless, thoughtless faith and science discusses what is most likely true based on certain observable and testable phenomenon. 
 I will grant that sometimes scientific theory can be a bit of a self perpetuating cycle. Scientists are human and thus will sometimes see disruptive theories as threatening to their work and contribution. The field has several mechanisms to overcome that.","Scientists almost never ""prove"" what they set out to ""prove"" with personal and historical anecdotes."

AskReddit,c82sqmx,"I have never told this story, so forgive me if it isn't as practiced or fluent as the others in this thread. It happened early October of 2008, so the details are coming back to me as I write (it has been quite a while). 
 Growing up I had a cat, Margo. She was all black with light yellow (almost green) eyes, though she started to go grey in her old age (with a small patch of white appearing on her chest). My parents got her before me, making her about a year-and-a-half older than myself. She was just a kitten when I was born; we grew up together. 
 By the time we moved to the new house, she was already nineteen and going senile. She would forget where she was, screaming as she got lost in corners. She would urinate often, forgetting where the litter box was (though I always forgave her for going on my belongings, I tried to understand). Worse of all, she would scratch for extended periods of time, digging her claws into whatever part ailed her (often the back of her neck). She developed scabs over time. We considered putting her down as she limped from her self-inflicted wounds and arthritis. I begged them not to; I knew Margo my whole life. 
 By the time October rolled around, I was in my Senior year and I never had the chance to look at the colleges out East that I was applying to, living in suburban Chicago. A long weekend came around, and I decided to pack up and go on a grand tour of campuses (more simply, a road trip). We put Margo (along with another cat we adopted a few years prior) in the garage with plenty of food and water and a litter box. We went to as many campuses as we could, sometimes driving through one en route to another. We must have been in Blacksburg, VA when it happened. 
 I was trying to get a good night's sleep for the tour I was going to have (a proper tour, with a tour guide and everything, not just sights through my passenger window). I started having a nightmare, everything in black and white. I dreamt that I returned home to find Margo scratching incessantly. Suddenly, she scratched too deep and started bleeding. Bright red blood. Everywhere. It wouldn't stop--  she  wouldn't stop. I kept yelling to her, pleading, ""Stop!"" Louder and louder. Finally I woke up to my own voice screaming, "" Stop !"" I was soaked in sweat. It was so vivid that I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. It took a couple hours for me to settle my nerves, convincing myself that it was just a dream. I ended up with a decent night's sleep and enjoying the tour later that day. Eventually, we set off on the long trip home. 
 When we returned home the next day, the feeling that something was wrong also returned. Patches, our other cat, welcomed us with his usual cries for attention/chastisement for leaving him. I ran into the garage calling, ""Margo? Margo?"" After a few seconds, I saw her lying in the middle of the room, towards the back. I ran, trying to convince myself she was asleep. Though as soon as I saw her, I knew the truth. After catching my breath, I slowly walked outside to tell my family through the lack of breath and lack of words that Margo had died. I had never dreamt of a pet dying before or since. By the amount of fleas present, I realized that she may have died around the time I had my dream.","I had a cat that was older than me. Though I had never had a dream of her dying before, I had a vivid one while away on a road trip. By the time I came home, she had died, likely around the time I had my dream."

Eventually she moved away from home, and I moved out to college. We stopped talking, but I always had her number in my phone. Anyway, about 5 years had past since I had heard from her, I was living in LA and she in NJ. 
 One particularly average day, while taking a shit and flipping through my contacts like usual, I stumbled across her name and thought 'Huh, I haven't talked to her in a while'. So I sent her a text. ""Hey, long time no chat, how are you?!"" She replied by telling me how weird it was that I texted her, because tonight was the night she was killing herself. 
 In the years that we hadn't talked her life had taken a drastic turn for the worse. She had a boyfriend whom she had two children with. He sold crack and abused her. Eventually they broke up and she became homeless, selling herself for money. At the point that I texted her she had an apartment, but she was working 3 or 4 jobs, and never saw her kids. 
 I tired to talk her out of it-- she wouldn't have any of it, but she told me how much I meant to her, and how much she'd miss me, and then she stopped responding to my texts. 
 I frantically rushed to find her on facebook, and from her profile I found both of her sisters profiles, and sent them messages urgently trying to find someone who could go to her and save her. One of her sisters got back to me soon after and said this: 'She's just trying to get attention, don't worry about her-- she's next to me doing dishes right now, happy as can be.' 
 A few hours later I got another message from her sister saying how when she walked back into the kitchen and confronted my friend as to why she said she was going to kill herself, she picked up a knife and tried to stab herself in the stomach and throat, screaming and crying about how nobody was going to stop her from doing what she had to do. Her sister restrained her and called the police. They came and took her away in an ambulance. 
 Her and I still talk to this day, and while her life is still tough, things have gotten much better-- and she's actually coming to visit me next week on her birthday. 
 It's situations like this that make me wonder just how much control we really have in life. The perfect timing of this entire situation still makes me think to this day.

AskReddit,ce2l6cu,"I'm a chronic cheater - I cheated on every boyfriend I had before I met my husband. The relationships were long over, but no one would end it so it was still wrong. I feel like I'm super familiar with the warning signs. 
 When my now-husband and I got engaged, we went through a period where work was very stressful for both of us, money was tight, and we were planning a wedding. My husband started to pull away and didn't want to be close physically and seemed more like a roommate than a lover. After he was making it a regular occurrence to go out for happy hour with 'coworkers'and being very weird about inviting me out as well (when before he always wanted me there) I pulled the trigger on going through his phone while he was napping one afternoon and found suggestive texts between a coworker and him. He was basically asking for nudes from her. I confronted him about it and he said it was nothing and then turned it back on me for going through his phone. (semi valid, but not when you actually find something). 
 We didn't resolve it for a couple of days, I went through his email the next day and found some other borderline inappropriate things. So I wrote a long letter and wrapped it around my engagement ring. I told him verbally when I gave it to him that I needed him to read the whole thing and only come talk to me after he'd really thought about what I'd written. I started the letter out with the explanation about the ring. 'Right now, it seems like this ring means something different to me than it does to you. I believe you that you've never done anything physically with this girl, but the interactions you've had via text and email are not appropriate for an engaged man.' 
 He took some time and came back and begged me to take back the ring and we had a long talk about trust, expectations, etc. He agreed that it was a crush and he liked that someone else had expressed interest in him, but he could never be with someone else, etc. 
 Now for what you actually asked about: The self confidence hit was the worst. I did ridiculous things whenever this girl came around in our mutual social circles. I'd dress to the nines for a night out bowling, it was sad. I had to have deep talks with my fiance about once a month for about 6 months about our relationship and things that happened during that period because I would get caught up in this spiral that he really didn't love me and wanted other things even though he's been completely devoted since the event. 
 The good news is that after 2 years, I rarely think about it. It doesn't sting, I don't get the rush of blood to my cheeks when I think about what he did, how i handled it, etc. I don't become terrified he's going to leave. I'm not angry any more. It's definitely a vivid memory, but it made me more sure that he's who I want to be with and I was willing to fight and work to make our relationship great. 
 This is going to be the controversial part of this post - I pushed my husband away. I was completely wrapped up in planning MY wedding. 'I want this' and 'There's now way I'm having that at MY wedding' I was just so self involved. I'm not saying you deserved to be cheated on, no one does, it's a really shitty way to deal with relationship issues. I truly feel the only way I was able to keep my husband from cheating is because I was so familiar with the warning signs. Cheaters validate their actions by nit-picking the actions or inactions of their current partner. I think there is some value in taking a look at your side of the relationship and making sure you're putting in what you expect to get out.","Talk about it, explore your actions and your partners, give it time. The negative emotions will fade. The memory will always be there. What you take away from it will be up to you."

He thanked me, and started saying stuff about how his friend was a drug dealer and how his friend left him miles away from home. It was then that I realized that he was slurring his speech, and he could barely keep his balance. Basically, this man was completely drunk and maybe even high. He asked me if I could go to a CVS with him, but I didn't know where that was, nor did I feel safe around him or the area that I was in. (I go to Rutgers University - Camden) I told him that I would walk with him to the train station, but that I had to go home. He made me feel guilty about accepting my help. Once I got to the entrance of the underground, he dropped his stuff again so I helped him. He asked for a hug, and I felt incredibly uncomfortable, but hugged him anyway. Lord knows I probably shouldn't have. He then asked me for change. I just wanted to go, so I gave him all of my change and told him to take care. He then called me a sweetheart and asked if I was married. I'm not, but I yelled out, ""YES! YES I AM!"" He then replied with, ""Aww, I was going to ask you if I could take you out to dinner sometime."" I apologized and tried to rush down the stairs with him still saying bye to me. I don't think I've ever feared for my safety more than that moment. I just wanted to help him pick up his groceries.",I helped a man pick up his groceries in a city that's unsafe. He turned out to be drunk and maybe high. It was scary.
AskReddit,cbr51zf,"My best buddy back when we were 8 years old or so was over at my house one day. Like usuall, we were out in the garden catching frogs, putting them in our pockets, running around and playing and whatnot. Suddenly he said he had to take a dump, fair deal, I thought, and went to play somewhere else while he did his business. Later in the day after he'd gone home I was outside when I suddenly noticed something on a big rock (50x50 cm or so) outside my house. On further inspection, what did I see but the most perfect shit I ever seen in my life lying on that rock. No jokes. 12-15 centimeters long, completely unbroken, very light brown color, lying there majestically in the middle of everything on top of a big stone... 
 I never really got the story from him, I think, but to this day, over a decade later, I still find it fascinating how he chose to not use our conventional bathroom but instead take a huge dump in the middle of our garden on top of a rock - the most unhidden place.","Child-hood friend laid a large, perfect shit in the middle of my garden on top of a large rock"

However, there weren't enough chairs, but since we were little kids we were told to just share a seat with a first grader.

I have no absolutely no memory of what was taught in that day.",one of my earliest memories is when I realized I liked girls.
AskReddit,c9sdh0h,"I don't know about someone with clinical depression, I just know about my own life journey.  I used to be very, very unhappy.  I was unpopular, socially awkward, and I hated my life. 
 When my family moved from one state to another, I took it as a chance to change my life.  My family had been moving about a lot (lots of reasons, but mostly that my father was not able to keep a job - he was very successful at first, but slightly insane, so he could not get along with anyone).  I was used to being ""the new kid"" at school.  In fact, I never attended any school for two entire years. 
 Anyway, in the 10th grade we moved.  I dreaded moving to a new school and being the new kid again, with the kids in the school discovering that I was a loner, a loser and start picking on me.  I was depressed, and severely unhappy about the situation. 
 I had seen kids come into schools as ""new kids.""  Some were immediately popular, while others were immediately labeled as losers.  I wondered how the existing kids knew right away whether someone was going to be one of the cool kids, or one of the loners.  It's like they were wearing signs or something. 
 I decided that since no one at the new school knew anything about me, I'd be one of the popular kids.  I watched how the popular kids acted in contrast to how the unpopular kids acted.  They were happy, open and outgoing.  They smiled at people, laughed and generally had a good time. 
 When I got to the new school, instead of acting like I always had, keeping my head down and trying not to be noticed (and picked on), I smiled and said hello to the other popular people.  I went out of my way to introduce myself to people, learn their names, get into the popular scene.  I was scared to death that they would figure out that I was pretending, but they never did. 
 I acted happy and outgoing, forcing myself to  be popular .  At the new school, I made a lot of friends, got invited to parties, took one of the prettiest girls away from her boyfriend inside a month (he was pissed for a while, but moved on.. we became friends). 
 It was fun, and I was happy, because I made a decision to be happy.  That's the secret, I decided, to being happy.  I graduated, went to college, and had fun for a while.  I didn't do very well in college, because I was spending too much time doing things other than studying.  After not too long, I dropped out.  Then came work. 
 I found that I could not make much money with no skills or experience.  Also, I was missing my old home.  So, I picked up and moved back to the city where I lived earlier.  Oddly enough, the move changed things back to the earlier days.  I was alone, friendless and unhappy.  I began hibernating in my apartment when I wasn't at my dead-end job.  I thought about suicide.  Life held no joy. 
 I thought back to how happy I'd been in the other city, in high school and the early days of college.  What had been different?  Was it the city? Was it the people?  No, I decided, it was me.  I'd allowed myself to become my old self, the sad one. 
 I once again made a decision to act happy.  I forced myself to reach out to others who were happy to make friends and go out and do things.  Within a few months, I again had an active social circle and started becoming a happy, outgoing person.  I made lifelong friends, had experiences that I still look back on with fondness - and sparked stories that others tell about me at parties.  It was a GREAT time. 
 I went to college again, this time making the decision that I would be a great student, would not let outside activities interfere with my pursuit of a degree. I made friends, became a leader of a group of fun, outgoing people who did all kinds of crazy things, some of my favorite activities from high-school, some new. We'd go hiking, camping, drive 4-wheel drives, explore caves, tube down white-water rivers, rock climb and rappel, fly hang-giders, play card games, board games, RPGs and watch movies all night in the apartment - generally have a great time. Then, as now, I was usually the instigator in what we did. 
 In my senior year, I met a beautiful girl and decided that I would pursue her.  Seven months later, we were engaged.  We've now been married for 20 years. 
 The thing is, I could have stayed a miserable loner.  For a while it appeared that I would be one forever.  Everything that I am now, every success that I've had in life, is due to the decision I made to not allow myself to remain unhappy.  It was scary and uncomfortable at first, and I felt like an impostor, but I did it anyway.  I'm very glad that I did.",My life was changed after I made the decision to be happy and outgoing.
AskReddit,c31xi8a,"I work as a photographer and was off shooting a freelance gig one day.  Little girl, long blonde hair in a field of tall grass sitting in a red velvet chair.  It was a gorgeous scene on a beautiful sunny day and nothing could possibly go wrong. 
 Nothing DID go wrong that day.  It was the next morning when I woke up and casually strolled to the computer to do some edits and started finger-combing my hair.  Combed the back of my hair, felt something ""odd"".  Hmmm... what's thi.... Yeah it was a tick lodged in the back of my scalp. 
 All rational thought went out the window.  I have seen what ticks look like when lodged in our family pets.  I wasn't about to allow this to continue.  I used one of my fingernails to dislodge the tick all while bawling and gagging.  (I am terrified of spiders, and ticks are their evil cousins). Now I am texting my mother begging her to come over to help me check the rest of my skin.  I am in the bathroom heaving and crying and I start to run my fingers along my hairline at the back of my neck.  Yeah, another tick.  Lodged firmly behind my ear. 
 Now I have lost it.  I am running around wretching and crying and snotting at the nose.  I know.  It was ridiculous. 
 I end up wiping tears off the side of my nose to realize that I have a foreign lump INSIDE OF MY NOSE.  It can't be.... Yep.  It is.

Both times I had to resort to a sterilized razor blade, a pair of hemostats, some alcohol and iodine, and something soft to clamp between my teeth. I cut around the wart with the razor as deep as I could stand, separating the cap from the healthy skin. Then I gripped it with the hemostats and ripped the fucking bastard out while cursing. Loudly.

AskReddit,clubqqz,"Okay, my experiences might be different than what you might experience, as I go to a Canadian College. 
 What's the difference you ask? Canadian colleges are similar to community colleges in the U.S., while our universities are like the U.S. college system. 
 But yeah, here's my advice: 
 -NEVER BE LATE FOR CLASS. This applies especially in your first five-six weeks of the semester. The professor won't respect you as well as they might if you were on-time most of the time. If they know you're usually on-time, then they won't be as mad as you compared to a slacker who doesn't come to class for the first time until Week 4. 
 -STUDY HARD, BUT NOT TOO HARD TO THE POINT WHERE YOU LOSE YOUR MIND. With my program, there isn't a lot of tests, but rather a lot of practical work, but it still compares to this. If you study so much to the point where you have four mental breakdowns in one week like I did, then you definitely need to relax. But don't stop studying. If you stop studying, then you'll start falling behind and end up failing your midterms or final exams. 
 -GET INVOLVED. The more you get involved in extracurricular activities, clubs, program-related clubs, etc., the more people you'll meet and the more experience you'll get that could (depending on your program) help with your future career. 
 With me for example, we have about 30 second-year students (more on that later) and about 60 first-year students. The newspaper for our program as well as the TV show we have on cable are mandatory to do something due to classes in second-year and a little bit in first-year, while our radio show isn't mandatory, but really helps with the other two. I got involved a lot in all three my first year and now I co-lead our school's radio show because I stepped up and helped out a lot in Semester 2. 
 To get to the point, a lot of the Year 1 students are really interested in radio and print, while the Year 2 students vary and on some days, there are more Year 1 students than Year 2 students at the newspaper meeting each week. Those are your times to shine and put yourself into a position to show that you care about the program/club/activity and become a leader in the activity in the near-future. 
 -DO NOT DROP OUT UNLESS YOU HATE THE PROGRAM/CONTENT TO ITS CORE. As I mentioned, there's a low number of students in Year 2 compared to Year 1. The program I'm in is a two-year course. When I first started, there were 65 students. By Semester 2, there were 40, and that went down to around 34 students this year. A lot of people drop out because they know they won't enjoy it, thought it was an easy program or can't afford it due to OSAP. If you think you'll hate the program you're going to go into, transfer programs. If you know you'll like it but don't want to put in that much work into getting good grades, then stay in the program. You'll hate yourself if you drop out of college due to you not wanting to work hard (or hard enough to succeed and learn.) 
 -OPEN UP TO PEOPLE. The more people you're friends with, the better. If you have 500 people in your classes, then try to talk to maybe 150 of them and be friends with a lot of them. Because of my program size, I know everyone in my year except for a couple of people who came back for more credits. Be social and be open. 
 That's all I got. I've had sex once so far in three semesters and it was a pain in the ass (think about it and you'll get it.) Just wear a condom and don't get STDs from having sex with multiple women/men. Especially people you hook up with while being drunk. 
 Also, don't drink or smoke weed. You'll end up having a fuzzy mind from your first time puffing second-hand smoke.",Don't be a lazy fuck-up and be confident. You'll do fine as long as you aren't stupid or lazy.
AskReddit,c1s7col,"What currently rocks your boat? Both the titles you list are B/W but very different in style. You say you like Watchmen.

AskReddit,c0vgalg,"Go to the court clerk, don't make a big deal about it.

AskReddit,c2ctl9d,"There is no established causative relationship between ""enlightenment"" (whatever the hell that means) and number of offspring. There are a few reasons we know there isn't one, in fact. 
 First, the number of offspring members of a given society have is well predicted by the economic development and stability of said society. Note, this has nothing to do with IQ or even education. BUT developed societies tend to have higher literacy, education, etc.., so you might be getting the causality backwards. 
 Second, education isn't heritable. You can get ""enlightened"" even if your parents weren't and vice versa. Even IQ's are partially the result of a decent upbringing/stimulating environment. 
 Third, intelligence is not ""true breeding"". It's only partially predicted by genetics, and it can't be a terribly big part because a) the human species has very  little  genetic diversity and b) just where the fuck do you think the smart people came from if the dumbasses outbreed them? They should have been eliminated eons ago. They weren't. They're here. They exist.

AskReddit,c2aqtfe,"I had a similar experience.. I was an overweight child. I am 5'5 and topped out at 170-180 in high school.  I had the lowest self esteem imaginable and it was hard for me to muster up the courage to do something about it. 
 My senior year, I started losing weight and from August to June, I lost about 35-40 lbs and ended up at 135.  I dropped even lower to about 127 in college. 
 After getting married and buying a house, the stress led my weight back up and now I'm stuck at around 145-150. I hate it and I'm terrified of losing control and becoming big again. 
 I constantly call myself fat and big and my husband gets so frustrated that he can't even listen to it. Which makes me feel worse.  But he was a skinny, skinny kid and I just don't think he knows what it felt like.",I completely agree that being the fat kid can screw you up emotionally.
AskReddit,c3silen,"Ah, so it seems like your in a similar position I was once in when I was still in high school. The majority of the people have already pointed you in the right direction by telling you to take baby steps but maybe my story may be of interest to you. 
 Up until the 10th grade, I had a hard time with school. I mean, I literally couldn't do basic math, spell, focus and I didn't even know what a GPA was until the end of my sophomore year. You could say that I had (and I did) a learning disorder (I don't like to admit it). There's no doubt in my mind that, if things didn't change that year, I would still be where I was back then intellectually. 
 You're going to have to come to a realization on your own if you ever want to succeed. Something has to hit you really hard for you to ""wake up"" like it did me. 
 It took the fact that I was intellectually inferior than everyone else to motivate me to try harder in school. Once I realized, I excelled almost immediately. I was able to take an AP biology course and was even recommended to my honor society. I now attend community college (on the fact that I still couldn't raise my GPA high enough to attend a university) where I have a 3.5 GPA and am vice president of my honor society and president of my math club. I work at the same school tutoring math and as my math professor's assistant. 
 Of course people's goals change as did mine. I learned that instead of focusing on becoming smarter than everyone else in the world (which I learned was impossible in my early stages of community college education) I would focus on learning to invest because I know now that my future is just as important. Why am I telling you this? Because you may find yourself changing goals earlier than I did and might hate yourself for ""going off track"". Well that's perfectly normal. 
 I say as long as you've figured out why and how you become the person you are now, you would have already gained all the strength you need to push yourself further. 
 You aren't in this position because you're physically weak. You're in this position because you're mentally weak. 
 The strongest men in the world aren't those who can overcome physical obstacles but those who can overcome psychological barriers. 
 By posting here, you've already made progress.",I was in the same position and got over it. Now I'm more stronger then I've ever been.

 On the way there, we stopped in San Angelo, TX to eat.  We intended to drive straiht through and not stop at a motel.  However, during dinner at Ryan's Family Steakhouse, my uncle Tom was consumed by severe pains, clutching his side and begging for milk, choking that his insides were ""on fire"".  We assumed it was the food.  To my young brother and I, this was terrifying.  My father and Tom rushed to the ER, after installing my brother and mother and I at a random motel.  We were bored and restless and traumatized and worried sick about our uncle.  We were flipping through the channels.  We saw this black and white movie with a weird bunch of silhouettes at the bottom.  We stopped to watch for just a second and we. were. HOOKED.  Including my mother.  She laughed till she cried at their many ""inside jokes"" about growing up Catholic.  Ben and I were very young, but we got enough of the humor to become obsessed.  That night, our fears melted away when we became enthralled with MST and were overjoyed to discover it was some sort of mini-marathon.  We've been obsessed ever since.  We laughed till our sides split, while my poor uncle was having his sides split by a kidney stone.  It was poetic.  He was well again by morning, and we continued on our drive.  That entire trip was spent trying to find out where and when we could watch more of the mysterious, wonderful movie show.

AskReddit,c3rmi5p,"I am currently 26. I work as a Freelancer for TV and other types of video shoots. My first job was the winter of 2009-2010. I was a Production Assistant and Boom Mic Operator for the TLC Series Mall Cops: Mall of America.
The west coast crew left for home, and I, a native of Minnesota was asked to stay and shoot (tape) a contest. I was thrilled at the opportunity to get to run camera on my first gig. One the fourth day of this contest, a man from New York had come to the Mall to commit suicide. Rather than using the parking ramp like most suiciders do, he decided to jump in the middle of the Mall's rotunda. Right where the contest was, right where I was working.
There was a big crashing sound as his femur hit one of the rails on the way down, causing him to spin and land head first. I did not see this happen, but heard from the Security Officers that this is how it happened. My first instinct was to grab the camera, but a PR person for the Mall said I could not shoot this kind of incident.
My next instinct was to help the Security staff. I had been working closely with them for the last few months, so I jumped up a level and started diverting people away from the incident. It took two hours for police to finish their investigation and the Mall to be able to clean up the mess.
Afterwards, the Security Director wrote a very nice e-mail to my boss on that job. I guess the Mall was worried we were going to make everyone look dumb, and the saw my actions as a way they could trust our crew. They approved a Season 2 right then. My boss was so thrilled with me, he took me to Kentucky to shoot Snake Man of Appalachia.

 First day the class used microscopes. I'd used them since getting one for xmas in third grade. I was bored. 
 So instead of following step by step instructions... 
 ""Place a bit of the water plant on the slide.""
""Put a drop of water on the slide.""
""put a cover on the drop.""
""Gently press it down""
...blah...blah...blah... 
 I'd mounted the plant, looked at it, drawn a sketch of it, and was exploring the stuff in the drop of water. I came across some amazing creature that looked like a horseshoe crab. And it was alive. I got excited and asked her what it was.

AskReddit,c0rr2qx,"Fast food is a problem but it isn't the source of the problem. 
 The source of the problem is the corn industry's crippling hold over our government. We subsidize corn so heavily in this country (USA) that it is actually sold BELOW COST to the food industry (meaning farmers can sell corn cheaper than it actually costs to grow it, and the government chips in for the rest). We also grow as much corn as possible even though there is no real market for it, again because there is no market risk involved for the farmers. 
 We no longer feed animals with grass. We feed them with corn, because we have so much of it (and cows cant naturally digest corn, so it fucks up their digestive system and is likely a cause of rising ecoli in our meat supply). Since we feed cows with corn now, which is essentially free, not only are we getting sicker cows and lower quality meat, it is cheaper too, which is why you can get a $1 burger at McDonalds (no hamburger should cost $1). 
 We have so much excess corn that we turn it into corn syrup and infest our drinks with it. And now we are putting it in our cars. 
 And what else do we do with our extra corn? We ship it to Mexico, again below cost. Problems? We bankrupted the entire corn farming industry of Mexico because it is actually cheaper for them to import corn from us (again, because we subsidize it), than it is to grow it themselves. So what happens when millions of farmers, farmhands, and their families go bankrupt working on Mexican farms? They come here. Illegal immigration anyone?","The corn industry, corporations, lobbyists and politicians are completing fucking over the American way of life."

AskReddit,cdj6tn6,"In the summer between my Junior and Senior year of high school, I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant.  We talked our way through it.  I told my parents.  She had the abortion while I sat in the Planned Parenthood waiting room.  At the end of summer, I started my Senior year.  I was changed.  Nobody knew. 
 The year long relationship died over the next three months.  I spiraled.  I started freaking myself out--imagining a young kid running through my house.  I ended up going to a therapist who told me to write a letter to the kid.  I named him and wrote the letter.  Every year since then I've written a letter on the anniversary. 
 It has molded me in several strange ways.  First and foremost, sex literally scared me for years.  It wasn't until I reached an age that I felt okay with having children that it stopped scaring me.  I stopped participating in abortion debates--except to ask the question, ""What rights should the father have?""

AskReddit,cb3well,"I spent 2 weeks in Hanover several years ago.  My friend is a youth worker and he was taking some young teens on an exchange trip.  I joined as an adult to help out. 
 I had a GREAT time.  People were very friendly.  We were invited to bbqs (it was a very hot summer) and parties.  We met a bunch of German rappers, Eminem lookalikes who took us with them in their van to a gig of theirs in Bremen and came to Berlin with us.  That was a crazy summer and we had great fun.  Some of those parties were brilliant.  I'm ashamed to say that I thought going to Germany as a black guy would be risky.  Sorry but that's how the country was perceived in Britain back then.  But everybody was nice and friendly and took us places.   Oh and they listened to 'Pac too. 
 Nobody would speak German to me though.  I kept trying to practice my German (which is quite terrible) but they all kept answering me in perfect English.  Even the kids.  To be fair, German is quite easy for an English speaker to pick up because they're so alike.  But I wanted to practice. 
 Hanover is really nice.  It's like two towns.  A modern futuristic town with big wide roads that looks all planned and neat and a center core of what old Hanover must have looked like with pretty cottages and stuff.  Where Martin Luther's house was they told me.  Oh and their diagonal elevator, that was cool.  I was impressed how everything was Mercedes.  The buses, taxis, lorries and so on.  Like for me as a Brit, Mercedes is a luxury brand.  But over there it looked like normal routine cars for Germans. 
 Berlin I was only there briefly.  Quick enough to do a bus tour and a walk about where the wall was.  I remember a building with a airplane sticking out of it for some reason.  But the guys I was with were there to shop not sight see so we did more of that.  Something that surprised me.  The quality of kebabs is amazing!  I thought that after Turkey and Greece the UK would have had that game but I guess there are lots of Turks in Germany so lots of kebab shops.  Very nice.

 He told me not to look in the case, or things could get messy. Suddenly, a different guy approached me, and commented on what a fine bag I had, he offered another thousand in cash for the bag. I was willing to do anything to get that bag out of my hands, so I gave the bag to him. With two thousand bucks in cash in my pocket, I felt relieved, then suddenly, I hear police sirens, and a freaking armored SWAT truck parks outside the airport, and a bunch of guys come out of it, yelling at everyone to get on the ground. I was thinking that I was gonna face some serious jail time. The guy who had originally given me the bag ran, and the guy who had taken the bag from me shot the guy in the back with a gun. 
 Next, I remember being told that everything was okay, and everyone could go back to their original business. No ambulance showed up, the body was taken by the SWAT team.

AskReddit,c6t83af,"I like to think that I did. Earlier this year around late April/early May, I was with my school for their 'outdoor adventure' program and we were canoeing. The place where we parked the van with the canoes and the spot on the river were we were putting in required us to cross a street. Because the edge of the river was almost entirely rocks and there was a somewhat steep hill going down to it, we decided to go across and 'chart a path,' so to speak, on how we were going to go down with the canoes. On the way back to the van, I was far ahead of everyone else and crossed the road before them. Despite having two very sharp turns on each end of the 100/150 feet of road that we were crossing, most cars and trucks were going 45/50 mph (about 72/80 kmph) instead of the posted 30 (about 48).

Being one of the stereotypical boarders from my school, she was completely in her own little world, used to the cars and trucks stopping for her on school property. As I saw her, I looked to my right. A truck was coming around the corner, speeding like the other vehicles. The only thing that my shit-under-pressure-brain could think to do was shout her name.

 They kept drifting directly from where I was sitting to my wife's nose. She had finally had enough and ran off to get some air freshener, and I got this great idea.... 
 So while she was running to the hall closet, I grabbed the pillow from the couch where she sits and let one rip directly into it. Laid the pillow back where it was, only upside down. She got back, fumigated the room with glade and went back to reading her magazine. 
 A few minutes later, she decided to lay down. In doing so, she laid her head directly on the tainted pillow. I saw her face become contorted, the same way as after you step on a dog bomb. I had a grin a mile wide by this point, all I could picture in my head was a cloud of stink emanating from the pillow and surrounding her head. 
 For the next fifteen minutes, all she could do was gag, tell me to stop farting and complain about the smell. Yelling that I needed carbon filters for my underwear and to go buy more air freshener. I about died laughing when I finally told her, she wasn't amused.

AskReddit,c28kztp,"This will be long, and I don't know what value it has but, I cried thinking about your situation and I just wanted to type something out. 
 I'm sitting at home when I should be at work, but nothing will be different wherever I am so, I'm typing.  The movie Too Many Husbands is playing in the background now and I've smoked about a half pack of cigarettes since getting up at 8. 
 My first girlfriend cheated. Best friend, New Years, with me passed out next to them. Separately, they both told me the next day. 
 I've never had a better situation than that. 
 Second major girlfriend. Cheated with best friend. Then, we got back together, and what? oh yeah, I later found out she cheated with at least two other 'friends'. Then, one day, while living with me, simply left. No note, no call, didn't hear a thing for a year, then when I saw her, she said nothing. I still wonder what the hell happened. 
 I met my future ex wife.  I kept an eye on her for five years, then married when I felt she was safe. One day, years into marriage, things felt 'off', and I asked her what was going on.  She said ""nothing"", and then I installed a hidden caller ID unit, as well as one she knew about. (Back in the day, when it was a new thing.)  I discovered that she was cheating with an employee/friend of mine. 
 Once I discovered that she was deleting phone calls, I hooked up a recorder.  One day I came home while she was working (Home business) and grabbed the recorder and listened.  ""Don't act like you like me when we go out tonight."" among other things.   Barf.  The worst was hearing her tone of voice. I realized I hadn't heard that happy tone in a long time. 
 A thirty year old man ran around the neighborhood like his hair was on fire. He ran so hard, so fast, and if anyone saw him they probably thought he was insane.  I'm quite sure he was, I just needed to do something other than break things. 
 I didn't know what was going on for sure so, I hired someone to follow her (Yep,  stalker move.) and told her that I had a meeting and wouldn't be home until late.   When the PI called, he told me the hotel they went to, and that there were 'rhythmic motions' coming from the car prior to entering the hotel. (The tracking device the PI had me install had a sensor for that too.)  Lovely. 
 I was livid. I confronted her.  (He was on the way to our home to go out with us, and I had 'seen' myself letting him in the door, then hitting him with a baseball bat.  I didn't, or I probably wouldn't be here now.) 
 We talked and she said she was sorry and that it wouldn't happen again.  Instead of her quitting, she started seeing him whenever she wanted.  It was terrible.  I didn't want a divorce, I wanted to have my life back. I was not prepared for this. I flat freaked the fuck out.  Day by day, I just kept trying/hoping it would work out. 
 This went on for almost three years.  It was hell. I couldn't (wouldn't, whatever.) let go.   I became a super stalker, and after a year, I started cheating too.  There probably isn't a trick that I didn't use to find out what she was doing.   It was like, if I didn't have proof, she would say that she wasn't doing anything.  It was ridiculous. I was ridiculous. I still am.  The sweet girl I was 'dating' didn't even hear me when I explained that I still wanted my marriage to work out. 
 I couldn't tell you the number of times that I'd say something like ""Where were you?"" and she'd lie, and I'd say ""No, you were 'here', and you parked 'here' and 'did this'.  Fools, both of us. What was the point? I even used my 'girlfriend' to spy on her.  Barf. What a fucking jerk. 
 My dad had gone through a lot of problems with his business, and long story short, he had placed everything he owned in my name.  His business, his properties and even his home.  Fearing the divorce would cost him half of his assets, I transferred everything back into his name, and started another business.  Meaning to become a less desirable target. 
 I'm still a less desirable target, ten years later.  Without me, dad made a few bad decisions and had some serious bad luck, and he's currently in debt so bad that there's no way it will ever get better.  Me too. 
 Next girlfriend, cheated with a close friend, whom I had just spent about a week with while helping him with the loss of his father.  I used to run into them at our old favorite bar, where he would drunkenly apologize to me.  She never did. They're married with kids now. 
 Next girlfriend, cheated with a coworker of hers. 
 Currently, I'm dating someone who was dating someone else when I met her.  I'd been single for five years and when she contacted me through an old aol profile, I thought, what the hell, I guess I'll be the other guy for a change. 
 I didn't expect I'd be dating her five years later.  I also didn't expect to almost lose my home or that I'd have to use her in order to save it.  Now, she owns my home.  A while back I caught her webcamming with an old fuck buddy.  Then, a few weeks ago we had lunch, and then she said she was going to go to the mall.  She didn't. 
 As I was heading back to work, I saw her drive past the mall exit.  I didn't say anything, she could have been going to a preferred gas station, or whatever.  Days later, we ended up in an argument about something stupid, and for whatever reason, she said ""You don't trust me."" 
 That's when I lost it.  I said ""You're probably right, you know why? Here's an example of why I might not:  Remember last week when we had lunch, and you said you were going to the mall?  Well, you missed your exit.  Where did you go?"" 
 She tried to lie, and kept trying to lie, then finally told me it was someone she used to see when she was dating someone else (A fuckbuddy) but that there was nothing going on.  Pretty much the same story as the webcam guy.  (""I just thought it would be hot."")) 
 So, I'll be 45 in about a day, ""my"" home is in my girlfriends name, and I'm dealing with a level ten cheater who might even be sneakier at evading detection than I am at detecting.  Especially considering that over the course of five years, she's heard most of my stories about such matters. 
 (example of her sneakiness: Her boyfriend thought she was cheating, so one day when she said she was going to a movie in order to see me, she had me drive to a theater and bought a ticket, for proof. A new trick, to me.) 
 She says she loves me, and desperately wants to get married.  She's actually tried to ask me. 
 What am I going to do?  Fuck if I know.  I'm hoping for a lottery win.  (I never have spare cash to buy tickets.)  Frankly, there's been a couple days I just thought I'd take my fastest vehicle and run it into a wall, but I'd never do that to my parents. 
 I'm so sorry for your situation.  I wish I could do something more than commiserate, or share stories.  I guess, if nothing else, you can see what kind of results you get from actions like mine.","A)  I'm a maladaptive, broke, jaded, cheater magnet with stalker tendencies. 
B) Don't let this happen to you.
C) FML 
 Oh, and if you're on the west coast, I can probably help you find a cheap car or keep whatever you find running.

AskReddit,c4jhoi6,"Similar story regarding my wife (girlfriend at the time).  At my wife's childhood home, a double-wide trailer about 15 minutes outside a mid-sized city in Georgia, strange happenings kept reoccurring.  When she was about 15, she started noticing random pieces of underwear going missing.  My wife is neurotic about her belongings, very meticulous and organized, and does not lose generally lose things.  While this in and of itself is an odd occurrence, she just assumed it was the household cat making off with these items and hiding them. 
 Once she began to notice these items as MIA, she and her family began noticing other odd happenings.  Their back door would be left slightly ajar, not something that would happen under normal occasions as her mother, too, was neurotic about locking the house up when they would leave for the day.  So in addition to the underwear going missing and the door being inexplicably left open, she also noticed one piece of her blinds facing the neighbors house had been broken.  Originally attributed to the household cat getting into mischief, the manner in which the blind was broken was odd.  Instead of the piece being jagged and rough on the edges, the break was clean as if it were cut by scissors.  So, all in all, this did not seem like a big deal in and of itself as these things happen regularly.  To remedy this, a piece of cardboard was cut and placed between the blinds and the window. Now every so often, she would go into her room and notice the cardboard on the floor, and again, the household cat was initially blamed.  This seemed odd as well since it was seated between the blinds and the window, and an outside force would have to physically remove the cardboard. Things began to add up at this point. 
 Her whole life growing up, she'd had the same neighbors, and seeing as her family lived in somewhat rural Georgia, her neighbors house was about 100 yards away with the respective driveways situated right next to each other gradually curving away to the houses.  This neighbor drove a back-hoe for a living, and it was parked each night between the two driveways.  On a regular basis, my wife, coming home from her job at a coffee shop late at night after closing, would notice that her neighbor would be sitting either in the cab of his truck or the cab of the back-hoe in the dark with seemingly nothing else to occupy his time.  At the time it was assumed that he was escaping his house in which there were four children and his wife.  Little did she know that he was waiting for her the whole time. Each and every night. 
 Fast forward to a couple of years ago: my wife was again coming home from her job closing up at the coffee shop, and had stopped at my house on the way home for some late night derpin.  Generally she would call or text to let me know she made it home safely, and on this particular night, I called because I hadn't heard anything yet. She answers and yells ""there's someone outside the house!"" and promptly hangs up leaving me with a WTF moment.  Repeated calls with no answers start to worry me.  Turns out, she had left her phone in the car and went to get it, subsequently noticing a man outside her window.  She immediately calls her mother to wake her dad, and ""bring a gun"".  He does just this.  In a sleep induced stupor, he stumbles outside with a 12 gauge shotgun, and, upon seeing the perpetrator of tom peepery, yells ""I'll kill you MOTHERFUCKER!!""  At this outburst, and once the neighbor notices her dad has a shotgun, the perp jumps under the house (in true double-wide fashion, it was supported on cinder blocks open all around the base).  This man would have been ground beef had the safety not been on, however the second attempt was more successful.  Squeezing off a shot, the neighbor was not hit directly by buckshot, but a few pellets hit home.  He then escaped out behind their house and into the woods. 
 After this final incident occurred, the puzzle pieces were put together.  The neighbor had been going into their house, stealing her underwear, and after cutting her blinds to see in her window, would then re-enter the house to remove the cardboard from the window.  To sum it all up, the police were called, and when they arrived, the first thing they asked was ""did you get him?""","my wife's childhood neighbor repeatedly broke into her house, stole her underwear and cut her blinds to peep into her window late at night for at least 5 years.  perp is discovered and dad comes to the rescue and shoots him in the ass with a 12 gauge."
AskReddit,cm35fnv,"I finally get to tell this funny story. On mobile so please don't shoot me. 
 I'd also like to point out that I LOVED senior year. I love my high school, I love all the students and friends that I met at school, and that there is no hate in this story. Just facts. 
 Also like to point out that it was really late when I was typing it all out on my phone. So if I start to trail off and tell a different story, it's from sleep deprivation. I just really wanted to get to tell this story while this thread is still on the front page. 
 So for the story you'll need a little context.
2013 I was kicked out of my high school that I was going to for 3 years, and they didn't tell me until 1 week before school started. 
 Having no options since most, if not all, schools in the area were full at that time, I had no choice but to go to -what a layman would call- a last resort kind of high school. 
 It was the kind of highschool that accepted anyone and everyone. No matter the circumstance. 
1.2 gpa? Of course! Fresh out of Juvy? Why not! 3 days until the first day of school? That's where I fit in. 
 The high school I went to senior year was -for lack of a better term- Ghetto. I'm talking fights everyday, drugs being sold and done in the cafeteria, teachers quitting every other month, teens bringing their 2 year old children to school. The teachers were bad, the principle was bad, a good fraction of the students were bad. It was pretty bad. 
 I too fell into this category. I was kicked out of my highschool for beating the shit out of a freshman. Not proud of that, but that's another story. 
 Anyway, first day of school. 
8:15 
 I'm in my first period English class. Sit in class for 30 min waiting for teacher to show up. Overheard someone say, ""Shit man, mr. Soandso quit? He was hella chill."" 
 Mr. Soandso was supposed to be our English teacher. 
 Then the principle sticks his head into the room and says ""We will find a replacement for Mr. Soandso by the end of the week. For now just sit and wait until next period"". 
 That was we did. We waited. I looked at the clock it was 9:00, and second period didn't happen until 9:30. Another half hour I had to sit there. So there I was just sitting in a godforsaken school, in a class room with no teacher, regretting ever smashing that kids face in, when this asian kid sitting in front of me turns around and says hey. 
 I say, ""Oh hey man. What's up."". 
 He goes, ""Du hello, ma name is da Minh."" 
 -I'd like to point out that he spoke English better that I probably did. It's just his accent was as thick as the fog. Prefect English, just THICK accent. This is the way that I heard it. I'm trying to spell it the way it sounded to me.- 
 Being the asshole that I am, I say, ""Oh hey, nice meeting you I'm Kenneth, funny accent you got there Minh"" 
 And minh says, ""Oh yeah, duh I come from a duh, Vietnam. I come to America one month uh-go."" 
 And I said, ""Oh shit, you come from Vietnam. So you speak Vietnamese?"" 
 Minh says, ""Oh yeah, I speak uh duh Vietnam"" 
 At the time, I only knew one thing in Vietnamese. And that was how to say ""Fuck your mother"" I heard a comedian say it. Soooooo.... Without skipping a beat I said, ""DoOOooMah"". 
 Which meant fuck your mother in Vietnamese. And he goes ""Who duh fuck are you!"" And laughs. 
 And I said, ""Welcome to America buddy."" And we've been best friends ever since. 
 That's how I made one of the best friends I have ever made in the fucking world. 
 Minh was the funniest fucker I have ever met. He wasn't slapstick funny. Like the three stooges. He was like Stephan Colbert funny. He was witty funny. 
 Unlike the rest of the school, Minh was no shit head. The highest math and science classes at our school, he did in his freshman year. 
 I tried to scam him with some of the card tricks I knew, but he knew them too. Hell, even better than me.  We then spent a few days scamming freshmen with this trick with coins that he taught me. 
 I could tell you a hundred stories of our adventures at this school. I could also tell you a hundred more stories of JUST the school. But I'll save that for another time","First time I met one of my best friends, I said, fuck your mother in his language."

 I was cleaning my parent's garage and watching my grandmother (who lived with them) on my first Christmas home from college so they could go on vacation. I was moving a box and was standing on a stool. As I stepped down, I had my leg at an odd angle. Apparently, one of the tendons in my leg was weak, and by getting my leg at just the right angle, plus the weight of the box dislocated my kneecap, which gouged a large chunk of cartelidge out of my femur. No pain, instant endorphin rush - I've never had a serious injury before but I've heard it described and knew it was bad. I was able to get the garage shut and get to the couch before the pain set in. 
 My girlfriend at the time had a doctor for a father, so he took a look at it. I figured it was twisted or something and I'd have a few weeks of bed rest. ""no, this is bad"" he goes, and refers me to an orthopedic surgeon. The surgeon sticks a heavy gage needle into my kneecap, and proceeds to suck out this mixture of blood and cartridge and who knows what. He fills the entire syringe, empties it into a Styrofoam coffee cup, and keeps going till the cup is full. I'm scheduled for arthroscopic surgery like two days later, a week before school starts. 
 The first surgery attempted to pin the loose cartelidge back, but it was unsuccessful. The doctor scheduled a second surgery over summer break. This surgery is full incision, and will require me to be on crutches for two months. At least I've got the whole summer. Anyway, this surgery was a success, and the pain wasn't as bad, but the surgeon goes ""with how little cartelidge you have left, you'll probably need a total knee replacement by the time you're 40"".

 It was caterers, looking for someone's 18th. They came to the wrong house.

 Eventually they figured it out when the company phoned them up to ask we're they were, they probably knew anyway saying as we CLEARLY weren't 18.

AskReddit,cok1kmz,"I got in a motorcycle accident last year. Flipped over my handlebars into the next lane over. Thank God the lady was paying better attention to the road than I was.  She stopped her car and used it to block some of the traffic while she ran over to help me. She knew absolutely nothing about first aid and tried to yank off my helmet. I was just conscious enough to tell her that was a bad idea. 
 Even though I was wearing full gear, I landed on my chin (literally the only part of my body that wasn't covered by gear). 
 Next thing I remember is waking up in the middle of the road with a paramedic standing over me. I instantly started cracking jokes about how stupid I must look and he told me I sounded a lot better than I look haha. It wasn't until my mom came to pick me up that I saw my face. My chin was completely busted open and I had blood all over my face. I gave myself the name 'Bloodbeard' after that. Unfortunately the lady had left the scene before the paramedics had finished helping me but since then I have often wished that I could have thanked her for her help. She very well could have saved my life by blocking the traffic. 
 I ended up having to get stitches on my chin, a sprained pinky, and the back of my right leg on my tendon got sliced open by my rear brake lever. I still don't have feeling in it to this day. Overall, not too bad considering the situation.

 Now, this teacher was a pretty young guy, and he was one of the football coaches. He was pretty jacked, so it was pretty easy to tell he did football, or some other sport. Anyway, his family had a history of colon cancer, so he had to start getting colonoscopies in his twenties, just in case. 
 From his telling, his first colonoscopy sounds like the most horrifying experience I can imagine. He was lying on his side on the table when the anesthesiologist and the doctor doing the colonoscopy walk in. 
 The anesthesiologist looks at him and says, ""Oh, big Mr. Football Player, not so tough now, huh?"" 
 My teacher looks at him and says ""What the fuck?"" Just as the other doctor holds up the device used for colonoscopies and says ""I'm going to shove this up your ass!"" The anesthesiologist then put the mask on him and knocked him out before he could reply.

AskReddit,cggtabf,"government self report survey from 2010-2012 I think it was from the CDC 
 Lol wat?  Gov survey from 2010-2012 from the CDC?  You mean the [NISVS]( 
 Well, let's see what that says: 
 >Nearly  1 in 5  women (18%) and  1 in 71  men (1%) have been raped in their lifetime. Most female victims of completed rape (80%) experienced their first rape
before the age of 25 and almost half (42%) experienced their first rape before age 18 (30% between 11 and 17 years old and 12% at or before the age of 10). 
 >  More than a quarter of male victims of completed rape (28%) were first raped
when they were 10 years old or younger. 
 > Approximately 1 in 21 men (4.8%) reported that they were made to penetrate someone else during their lifetime 
 > An estimated 13% of women and 6% of men have experienced sexual coercion in their lifetime (i.e., unwanted sexual penetration after being pressured in a nonphysical way) 
 If you add ""made to penetrate"" to the rape criteria for men, you get ~1 in 5 women (18%) vs ~1 in 17 men(5.8%) that report being raped in this survey.  So, women still are more than 3 times as likely to be raped as men. 
 > Across all types of violence, the majority of female victims reported that their perpetrators were male. 
 > Male rape victims and male victims of non-contact unwanted sexual experiences reported predominantly male perpetrators.  Nearly half of stalking victimizations against males were also perpetrated by males. Perpetrators of other forms of violence against males were mostly females.","The stats are not ""about equally"" even if you add ""forced to penetrate"" into the definition of rape.   Women are approximately three times more likely to be raped than men.   The majority of rapists for both genders are men.

AskReddit,clraf1d,"SHORT STORY TIME:
I was at a ski hill with a buddy and we had just gotten all of our stuff that we weren't taking on the hills into lockers. So anyway, we're waiting in line to get tickets, but there's only one family in front of us, so it wouldn't take that long.
We were so very wrong. 
 The family took upward of a half hour to order their fucking ski tickets
""Does the all day pass really mean ALL day?""
""What does the resort pack include?""
Also, I should mention that this is in Minnesota, and they're from Florida. They're chatting with the desk man talking about their family in Florida, and making analogies about the temperature here, trying to be funny ""It's colder than my freezer up here!"" (Hahaha). They continue to talk about every fucking difference between Florida and Northern Minnesota for 30 minutes. 
 Anyways, me and my nameless buddy were looking at each other with eyes that say ""are these people just tryna fuck with us? Or are they serious..."" The desk dude even looked at me with a ""I'm sorry, I have to serve these people, it's my job"" face. 
 They're finally done with their yammering and we step up to order our tickets. 
 I'm going to describe how we were situated next to the family I'm describing. Me and buddy were standing to the left of their spot in front of the desk, not behind them. We were tired of carrying all of our winter clothes on our bodies and our skiing gear in our arms, so we're leaning on the counter in front of the desk. 
 So anyways, about 30 seconds before the annoying family left, another family showed up in line. But they got in line behind them, so they thought we were some bums just leaning up against a counter. 
 I was about to shove the family in front of me out the window if the didn't finish up soon, so I was almost about to snap. 
 Walk up to the desk, say ""two 5-hour ski passes plea--"" 
 And then the mom of the family cuts me off ""excuse me, you budged in front of us, you need to wait in line"" and then she proceeds to try to shove between me and my friend,  and wave her family to walk past us as a group. 
 I stick my arm straight out to block her, and fucking can't hold in my frustration anymore. There were kids present,  but I didn't hold back. 
 My friend is a pretty goody-two-shoes guy, and he knows me well enough that I was about to unleash the fury of a thousand dying suns. He looked at me with a ""they're not worth it"" face. I gave him an angry ""Their lives aren't worth it"" face,  and proceeded to say this, I remember it verbatim, as as it was the most angry thing I've ever said to a stranger: 
 ""Listen up bitch, do you know how long we've been standing here? All we wanna do is order two goddamn passes. The whole ordeal will take a sum total of 5 seconds between the two of us, but you'd rather have us wait behind another fucking family of seven, for another half hour? Just so your family can have your tickets 5 seconds sooner? Are there any velvet ropes that indicate where a line should be? NO!!! So maybe you should go back in your fucking prius and stop making stupid-ass assumptions."" 
 I promptly stormed off with my ticket, my friend in shock. I was expecting the husband to say something angry in retaliation in defense of his wife. His wife looked looked at him angrily as if to say 'do something, he's getting away'. But the husband said outloud, ""I'm sorry honey, you crossed his line""","went to get ski tickets, my patience broke, and a lot of suggestive faces were exchanged."

AskReddit,c82v6ff,"I had spent the weekend visiting friends out of town and caught a late night flight home to Los Angeles on Sunday evening. By the time I arrived in LA it was around 11:00pm. I was an intern at an ad agency at the time and lived in Rancho Cucamonga (I commuted from there about 55 miles each way) so I decided I didn't want to drive back that far just to wake up at 5am to repeat the drive and that I would just sleep in my car or at our office, which is very close to the airport. I had heard some comments here and there around the office about it being ""haunted"" but I didn't think much of it. 
 After unsuccessfully trying to pass out in my car, I make it to the office around 2am where all is dark and except the red glow of some exit signs. I make my way to a couch inside and try to pass out. 3am rolls around, and I'm awoken by a very harsh, hissing, mean sounding voice in my ear. It went on for what felt like forever but in reality was probably about 5 seconds. My best description is it sounded like parseltongue from Harry Potter, only louder and angrier. It made no real words I could make out, but the entire time the voice was hissing in my ear, my whole body was frozen stiff and there was a muscular tension shaking going on in my head (like when you yawn and your hearing fades a bit, but you can hear your muscles shaking in your head). While all this is happening, I felt like I was awake and fully aware of where I was, why I was there and all of those things that might otherwise be obscured by having a dream. 
 The instant the voice ended, my eyes opened and whole body was shaking. I decided I would get the hell out of there. Briskly walking to the door, I made sure just to keep my eyes to the ground in the event that my mind played tricks on me and I ""saw something."" I made it out the door, into my car and proceeded to drive for a while to try and make sense of what I thought happened. 
 Fast forward to the next morning at work where I reluctantly share the story with a co-worker, expecting to be laughed at. Turns out this story sounds familiar to her and goes to grab one of my other co-workers. Without any prior knowledge of each other's ""experiences,"" he describes the exact same voice I heard and a similar experience as a result of a late work night.","Weird, angry ghostly voice yells in my ear while sleeping in office, co-worker corroborates story, I vow to never again work a late night alone."

I turned to my mom and asked if I could go help the boy. Granted with permission, I head up the hill. 
 As it turns out, his dogs had escaped and were now running around his yard, outside of the fence. I recruit my twin sister and older brother to help retrieve the two terriers. It wasn't easy, and they escaped from our small hands many times, but eventually we succeeded. Or so we thought. The boy released the dogs, and once more we had to retrieve them. 
 I remember thinking how odd it was that this family still had their Halloween decorations out, especially one so creepy. The decoration was made to look like a man, lying on the ground. It bled from the mouth and moved its arms robotically. Once the dogs were released by the boy, they immediately ran to the thing and began licking its face.

AskReddit,c2b311z,"I reckon this is the most badass nudie run I have ever witnessed. 
 A mate of mine had done a couple of warm up runs at a 7-11 earlier that night. Just low level public nudity compared to what I dared him to do later on. 
 It was a Friday night around 11pm, and we were driving through the downtown area in our city, a place with a large pedestrian mall. There were hundreds of after-work drinkers and people out on the town. 
 So I dared my mate to run the entire length of the mall, probably 500 metres, in just his sneakers. After a bit of negotiation, he agreed to do about 2/3's of the length for a small fee. $15. 
 The plan was to drop him off in my car, have another mate run behind him to witness and verify, and zip down to the end of the mall and wait for him in the car. 
 The second he left the car I literally pissed my pants laughing. The other guy in the car, upon hearing about my hilarity-induced incontinence, does the same, and pissed his pants laughing. 
 So we zipped down to the end of the mall and wait. And wait. And wait. Eventually the other guy, who ran 10 metres behind the nudie runner, got to our car and explained what went wrong. 
 At the very bottom of the mall, with about 10 metres to go until my car and freedom, our mate was arrested. We looked for him among the sea of people, and there he was with a burly cop holding each arm, and him covering his junk with his hands.

AskReddit,cbgfxos,"I was sophomore in high school, and my friend (lets call him Jeff) had just graduated. Anyways, his parents are pretty cool about him and whatever he does, so they went out of town and told him not to have a party, but a few friends would be ok. 
 He invited me over, I had no idea that there was alcohol, so I didn't drink. I was 16 and everyone else there (~10 people) was 21+ except Jeff, whom was 19. So Jeff got hammered, everyone else was passed out. It was 3am and he hit up a girl for a booty call. I refused to let him leave, but he wasn't having it.. 
 I ended up driving him because I didn't want him to get hurt. This was when I had my permit, and lacked in the skill of driving, but I had to do it. It's hard to stop a horny drunk guy. 
 Using the gps, we made it to her house. She got in the car.. the lights in the car turned on when she opened the door.. I don't know what my friend was thinking. She was just.. no. Looked like a truck. I don't like being mean to people, but she was just hideous, and I mean Jeff is a pretty good looking, charismatic guy.  I couldn't let him go through with this. 
 As she was getting in the car, I ask if she can run inside to get a bottle of water because Jeff was complaining about being thirsty. She agreed and went to get a water bottle. As soon as I saw the house door close behind her, I peeled out and went right the fuck back to Jeff's place.  He was pretty upset at me, but I told him to just shut up until we got back. 
 We got back and went inside. I told him to lay on the couch, because I had to go take a piss real quick.  I come back and see that he is asleep, so I decide for bedtime as well. 
 The next morning, he asks if he called anyone for a booty call, and told him to look at his phone.  To his dismay, he saw the number and said ""PLEASE tell me she's not upstairs in my room right now"" 
 I explained what happened and I don't think I've seen anyone so happy to hear they didn't get laid. so to repay me, he invited a girl over for the next night of continued drinking and I got laid.","drive drunk friend to pick up booty call, peel out before she gets in the car because ugly. he thanked me with sex."
AskReddit,caia6uy,"M-17) As a shy person that is social network friendly, ill try to give my best advice.
Social networking can be awesome but terrifying at the same time because you get to interact with other in a completely new fashion, however it can feel lonely and rather scary if you interact with strangers or hardly anyone online. My advice would be to just take it one step at a time, maybe post a few things here and there that you wouldn't mind other people seeing just so you can slowly get comfortable doing so, since you seem to have no problems meeting people, that would take care of the issue of making friends, I think that should cover the basics, I hope this helps",take it one step at a time and you'll get over the fear/anxiety in no time
AskReddit,camftl0,"When I was 6 my mom brought me over to her friends house, she had known them since I was born and the lady had a son close to my age. We referred to them like family so he was my ""cousin"". He always loved to beat me up and just make my life miserable. 
 One day I had pulled open the sliding glass door and peeked into the room to talk to my mom. He came up and opened the door all the way, I thought that he was trying to walk past me but instead he walked a few paces to the side, took a running start and slammed my head with the solid glass door. I totally blacked out and ended up having to go to the emergency room. 
 Off topic, but later he got what was coming to him. He started picking on my brother and we were about 14 at this time. I got fed up with it, threw him to the ground, pinned him and started choking him out. Telling him if he ever touched me or my brother again I'd beat his ass.

AskReddit,cmhdp0u,"I am an American, currently posting from London, on my first trip to the UK. Thus, I've recently given this question quite a bit of thought by default. 
 1) Direction of travel  - For some reason cars drive on the left, people walk up and down the stairs on the left but when walking on the street, everyone seems to walk on the right. This could be the number of tourists on this particular week are outnumbering regular citizens (due to Thanksgiving). Yet, it's clear you are well aware that you do everything backwards. There are signs at most crosswalks telling you which direction to look for cars because you don't want people from 99% of other countries getting killed by a vehicle. Additionally, due to right hand drive, you overtake on the right. But for some reason, on escalators you stand to the right and overtake on the left. This seems even more convoluted and requires signs all over the escalators informing everyone to keep right. I don't really care which way you do it but just pick one way and use it for everything! 
 2) Prices  - This one is more baffling than stupid but everything here is unbelievably expensive. I understand some things like fuel as you are an island with limited available natural resources. As for everything else though, the rule is pretty much everything costs twice what it would in the states. I'm not just talking similar products but the exact same products as well. Even if it's a product produced in the UK. For example, Cadbury chocolates. The larger bars are £1.20($1.88) (printed on the packaging). The same product in the US (different packaging) can frequently be found for under $1(£0.64). Does not just apply to products but services and events as well (cabs are absolutely ridiculous). 
 3) Public transit  - Everyone raves about the tube and how great it is compared to any other means of travel in London. I don't disagree. The tube is awesome! It's cleaner and feels a bit safer than the NYC subways (near and dear to my heart as they may be) and is how I get pretty much everywhere. However, the fact that it closes between 12 and 12:30AM depending on the stop is absurd. Yes, even on weekends! It's not like this is some tiny city where there's nothing to do after midnight (especially on weekends). So yes, I hit the bars/clubs/shows earlier so I can take a tube to get there. But getting home is a nightmare as I wont pay for a cab and the night busses aren't particularly reliable and require frequent transfers which are also unreliable (I waited 40 minutes around 7AM this morning for the 148 that was supposed to be there 5 minutes after I got off the 390). Additionally, the Tube/Buses are pretty expensive compared to my home city of NY. I payed £36 ($56) for a weekly pass only for zones 1+2. Well worth it because the cabs are unreasonable as stated above. But compared to NYC where it's $30 (£19) for the entire city including some close suburbs like Westchester, it seems a bit high (see above section on all prices). 
 4) The ""Monarchy""  - I get it, tradition is important. But the money pit that is the British Monarchy just doesn't seem worth the tradition of it all. I saw King Charles III the other night (brilliant show, incredible acting, highly recommended) and it really laid out how absurd the whole idea of it is. The queen has essentially no power because if she were to try and use some of the limited power she still technically has, all hell would break loose as England is all about their democracy. She's a face. And a very expensive one at that. I don't pretend to be an economist but if you ask me, the monarchy doesn't seem worth the money spent on protecting the monarchs, their properties and their possessions. I know they attract some tourism but you're England, one of the most powerful countries in the world; people will come to see the history and the culture either way. I'm not suggesting anyone try to oust the current queen. However, she is starting to show her age. A law could be drafted saying that there will be no future kings or queens. When she does pass (of natural causes I can only hope), allow this faceless monarchy to sit with the people for some amount of time before dissolving the rest of it. I just don't see how the traditional gain outweighs the financial loss. 
 All in all, London is one of the most incredible cities I've ever visited and luckily that is quite a long list. I'd highly recommend visiting to anyone who can afford to do so. The people are awesome (if you are a redditor you already appreciate the sense of humor), the food is great (while I'm not a huge fan of traditional British fare, there are so many different cultures here who have brought their flavors into the mix), and the nightlife is pretty freaking incredible (as a young New Yorker, clubs that are open until 8AM is just what the doctor ordered), the women are incredibly beautiful (and don't frequently play games like so many American women do), and the city is incredibly beautiful with such a rich culture.","Pick a direction of travel and stick with it. Everything is twice the price of America. Public transit is awesome as long as you go to sleep by midnight (not redditor friendly). Monarchy seems like a waste. Regardless, if you can afford it London is a must see for everyone! Don't know about the rest of Britain."

AskReddit,ccifxih,"I live on a dead end street but I am connected to a huge neighborhood by sidewalk, so we have a lot of neighbors. 
 Basically there is a neighbor who is every age (don't know how to word it)
For example 
We have about 12 kids on the block and 2 of them are in 6th, 1 of them is in 7th, 1 of them is in 8th, 2 of them is in 9th, 3 of them are in 10th.
You get what I am saying? 
 
 
 not real name 
 
 
 
 Well ever since I was young we were always with the neighbors everyday, our parents all were close friends and we all treated each other like siblings, that is up until 8th grade. 
 One of my neighbors, Jean* was basically the town gossip but usually never talked about anyone our block, one day during Summer 2 years ago, I was sitting in their backyard eating an ice pop and we were all talking about school coming and stuff. 
 Then a girl from around the block, Jenna  walks by the house and the mom, Jean  starts talking really bad about this girl, I happened to like this girl, and just tried to ignore her. The girl was heavy and that was the first thing Jean pointed out. 
 Skip forward to beginning of school and I am asked by this girl and a couple of her friends to go to Friendlys so I go. The entire group of friends was extremely gossipy and I really didn't care for gossip so I kind of looked awkward. I tried to interject and change subjects but I wound up looking like an idiot, in my last efforts to get approval from this girl and her friends, I slipped up and told her what Jean had said about her. 
 Let me add something really important here, Jean is 50 years old and this girl is 12. 
 So I guess the girl was pretty upset and told her mom who then told another neighbor who then confronted Jean. 
 The next day at school I go to say hi to Jeans daughters and they literally huff and then walk away and at this point I don't know what's wrong. So I just began to worry. 
 Then in the middle of the day I see Jean in the school talking to her daughters, she pulled them out that day because she wanted to make sure I couldn't talk to them. 
 I then realize oh shit, I skip track and take the bus home, I am extremely upset and as I am walking from the bus stop to pick up my little brother I see Jean and immediately try to apologize and explain, she says ""I don't want to hear it, scum"" I was 13 and she was 50. 
 I then began to cry a lot and made my little brother run home with me. Then when I get home I tell my mom and she begins to tell me how big of a gossip this lady really is and how I shouldn't let her get to me, and to go play outside. So I did and everyone including the other neighbors ignored me, I ran inside crying. My mom then gets in the car and drives to Jeans house and gets out and starts to fight with her, not fist fighting but verbal. 
 Throughout the fight my mom is keeping her cool and basically stating facts about the whole thing and telling Jean it's not really a big deal, it's middle school drama, and why are you making such a big deal and stuff like that and the only words that ever came out of Jeans mouth were either verbally abusing my mom, or trying to completely ruin myself esteem. 
 Some of the things she said were,
""I can't take you seriously because you go to the gym everyday and show up in your sweaty clothes to  drop off your son and you still have let to lose a pound"" - To my mom
""He is a bad influence and a complete bully, he is annoying as fuck and an asshole."" 
""You walk around like you are the queen of this town but in all reality everyone hates you, you're a fucking bitch"" - to my mom. I am sitting in the car hysterically crying. 
 It has been 2-3 years since this happened and she still ignores me and treats me like dirt, I am fine with all the neighbor kids now but it's not the same, I never hangout with them anymore, and I have had terrible self esteem issues since then and only keep a few close friends.","This witch made me cry, my brother cry, and my mom cry and turned the entire neighborhood on us, it's been 2 years and she still is angry.

AskReddit,ceog6io,"I think whether or not it's really cheaper to go out/stay in depends heavily on what you  could  be doing instead. I mean, it's dinner, right? You've probably been off work for an hour to three hours. At this point, you wouldn't have been working anyway, and that just means you're paying for the cost of the food (and prep if you're going out) and you're not losing money because you're not working. 
 It's all opportunity costs 
 Here's how I think about it: 
 There are two types of time in the day: working time, and break time. The only difference between the two is that working time makes money. Eating out during Working Time saves you time, and is faster, so at $16/hour, you'll make the cost of a meal in the time that you would/could have spent preparing a meal. (Of course, that's assuming you're in and out and eat quickly. That's also assuming you're preparing the food for lunch instead of making it in the morning and bringing it.) 
 During Break Time, during which people normally eat dinner, you're not making money whether you go out or prepare your own food. Unless you're allotting time to do something else, it's probably cheaper to prepare your own food, because you're not paying for the food and the preparation. Just the food.","The deciding factor is less the actual cost of the meal, and more whether or not you could be doing something or earning money. Opportunity costs, opportunity costs, opportunity costs."

AskReddit,c8bmppo,"I'm not a repo guy, but I guess it's related. 
 I used to work in a vehicle rental place, and one Sunday after spring break a group of 5 girls returned a car, all of them looking extremely hungover. They handed back the keys and stumbled off to the nearest bus stop. Two of them were noticeably limping, and I thought it was pretty funny. 
 I mentioned them to my colleague, and it turned out he'd been there when they picked up the car a week earlier. They told him they'd rented a log cabin, and the five of them were going to spend spring break up there partying. We laughed and said it must have been quite a party given how ill they all looked. 
 A couple hours later, I dutifully headed over to the car to give it a quick clean and double check for any damage etc. Everything seemed OK except there were a couple of heavy bags in the trunk that I took back to the shop. My colleague opened them to see if there was anything important/valuable inside, gasped, and immediately called me over. 
 Both bags were  FULL  of sex toys of every type imaginable. Vibrators, dildos, nipple clamps, everything. There was even a rubber fist-toy that was bigger than my own hand (My colleague joked that it explained the limping). Some of them clearly hadn't been washed either as the bag smelt of... well, you can guess.

 When I was about 16 or 17. My sister called my mother and I freaked the hell out because she said there was someone/thing in the house. It was one of the first times she'd been at home alone, she said our cat was going crazy. My mother and I assured her it was just her imagination. 
 A couple hours later my mother and I get home and everything is normal - our suspicions confirmed. About 5 hours later, I'm talking to my mother around 11 pm, sitting in a large easy chair in our living room and I notice some scuff marks on the curtains. I say, hey what happened here and begin to pull up the curtain. 
 At that moment a squirrel jumps up and comes about 3 inches from my face, before falling back to the ground. He was trapped beneath the curtain and couldn't find his way out. So my mother decides to call animal control, but they're closed for the night, so the town sends out a cop, my former DARE teacher. 
 Upon arriving, surveying the situation she states, ""I don't know why they always send me on these calls, I'm terrified of animals.""

 Last year in general was a very rough one for me. I lost my cousin from complications with his heart while he was in a coma, My Great Uncle died from old age (he was 95), my grandfather was hospitalized twice for his lungs, and lastly, my best friend from whom I was inseparable had died. He was one of our 6 group of friends who considered eachother to be nothing short of brothers, so suffice to say this was more than traumatic for me. 
 The same night I found out he died I was working a graveyard shift as Desk Security. As you can imagine, there weren't many people coming in and out so the only thing to keep me company was the silence of the lobby, and my thoughts. In order to gain some measure of peace and closure, I decided to call my friends cell phone (which was still active at the time) and leave him a voicemail. For what seemed like hours I talked and talked, telling him how I felt, how much I missed him, etc.. After hanging up the phone I felt week and immediately fell to my knees in the middle of the lobby and with my face in my hands started bawling. I couldn't find the will to pick myself up off the floor until a fairly young couple came into the lobby and saw me there. I was fairly new at the time so I tried my best to regain what composure I had left and greet them properly. The man stopped me and gave me a big hug, and the lady joined in too.

So yea i flicked it in the street cause i feel wronged, like i used to be near things that i could dispose my butts(its really funny to say dispose my butts) in, but even then they have people who go around with brooms and dustpans that get payed to clean the butts off the sidewalk and curb areas.","Sometimes I don't know why i should go out of my way, when so much is done to push smokers farther and farther away"
AskReddit,cc2hnn2,"Sophomore year in College. Guild Wars had just come out. It's the night before one of my finals.  I send an IM to my buddy via AIM and say ""Hey man, I'll be right back.  Gonna grab a brownie.""  Little did he know I would not return (that night anyway). 
 The kitchen is down the hall from both my room as well as my parents and brother's room. I enter the kitchen, I retrieve a brownie, I turn off the light and start back toward my room. 
 What you need to understand is that the walk back was almost pitch black.  I walked a bit too fast apparently and slammed my face right into the corner of a wall on my way back.  I had that head numbing pain and suddenly my vision was blurry.  I was bleeding all over my glasses.  I figured ""Oh, maybe the... lens popped out and cut me?""

AskReddit,cj7sj1b,"Not me, but someone I worked with. I was there. 
 I used to work in masonry right out of high school. The lead mason who was with the company the longest made a critical error one day. We were working on an old house that had an great covered drive through gate at the entrance of the driveway, two brick pillars on either side of the driveway with a roof connecting them together. Imagine a covered bridge basically, but only about 8 feet long. So to make sure nothing happened to it, there was another temporary driveway built off the side so that driveway didnt even need to be used. The roofed entrance was very old.  The kicker for this was that the homeowners were set to get an award for this gateway from the city to commemorate it as a historical city landmark with a fancy bronze medallion . The homeowners were so proud. Horrible things are about to happen. 
 Well one day as we were nearing the end of our masonry work on the house, we were cleaning up the scaffolding and plank and bringing them back to the lot using a regular dumptruck. The smaller pickup sized ones. The lead mason had us place the plank with the back inside of the truckbed, and have the plank resting on top of the cab at the front.  12 to 16 foot long plank sitting in a 45 degree angle basicaly. The plank at the front must have been a good 15 feet high in the air. 
 All loaded up and ready to go, the lead mason jumps in and pulls away. Me and another guy still had some stuff to do so we stayed back. Lo and behold he doesn't use the temporary driveway and instead drives down the main driveway. I turned around just in time to see the destruction at hand. The plank hit the roof like a jouster, and the brick pillars on either side of the driveway snapped in half, and the whole roof came down on top of the hood of the truck still connected to the broken off pillars on both sides. Craziest shit I've ever seen happen.  It was so loud. The homeowner ran out of their house to see what happened, and instantly started crying/WTFing. The mason gets out of his truck with his red, embarrassed face in his hand saying ""Oh my god, I can't believe I did that."" over and over again. All I could do was stare wide-eyed at the scene. The mental picture is seared in my minds eye forever. 
 Shitty thing is, the homeowner never got that honorable historical medallion. Since we had to completely rebuild the pillars, it wasn't the original gateway anymore. Double whammo. 
 I never found out the true cost of this. I'd imagine my boss gave them heavy discounts on what we already did to their house, to go alongside the new free of charge gateway. I could see it easily being in the $20,000 range. Soooooo bad. Extreme fuck up.","Lead mason destroyed historical gateway entrance by jousting the roof with 16 foot plank on the truck.

AskReddit,cmtt33n,"I taught high school science for a few years, and had many of the best and brightest in the school in my advanced classes, and they were fantastic. I also had a few classes of students who were, shall we say, not so academically gifted, and although initially they were really frustrating it was because I didn't know how to handle them. Once I Iearned, those students became far more rewarding to work with than any in my advanced classes. I made it a point to connect with them as human beings, rather than to try to force them to do things, and to show them that science doesn't have to suck. They really appreciated that and I like to think I may have made a difference. 
 One student in particular was Joe. I had Joe in a 10th grade chemistry class from hell my first year of teaching, and other teachers had warned me about him (along with 90% of the other students in that class, to be fair). Something happened about a month into the class and Joe decided that he liked me. He listened and paid attention in class (which I heard later he didn't do in many of his other classes), would laugh at my jokes (no small feat, mind you; my jokes are notoriously awful), and would respond with jokes of his own. I don't have any specific stories of Joe, but he was that kid who made me smile every time I thought about him. His academic career after he left my class was undignified, but he graduated. When he did he sent me a really nice card to say thanks, and that meant more to me than any gift or card I got from my students who went on to do very well at very prestigious colleges.",students don't have to be good at school to leave teachers with good memories.
AskReddit,c76oa4i,"Ok, the extended version can be found here: 
This was the third of 4 ridiculous dates with this MILF, all of which are in the abandoned but awesome subreddit, /r/LastNight 
 In short, there was a bouncer in front of the bathroom (protecting his friends or some shit). He made me agree to get him some headies (in the hood, they only smoke mids) later that night (""Hook me up"" were a sample of his exact words). I agreed, he let me in, my MILF and the dudes came out. I got her out of there. 
 So anyway, I'm lying to myself that I got her out before anything happened (well, maybe she snorted coke but maybe she didn't yet insert their cocks in her mouth). So I tell her to brush her teeth for five minutes and then we'll go at it. Luckily, she has one of those mom purses that had to have came out of Hogwarts because they fit so much  shit in them. She digs down and pulls out a toothbrush, and toothpaste. 
 A few minutes later, she's naked on my bed when I get a call on my phone from the bathroom bouncer. He's at my door. I tell her to stay upstairs while I sell him the weed. Everything's good and dandy and he's about to leave when she comes downstairs in her underwear. She asks him if he has anything other than weed that can get her fucked up.

 Then she asks, ""Do you have one for him?"" He says no and she agrees anyway. I wouldn't have taken it, but to relate it to the question prompt, she thought she was doing it at least a little for me. 
 So she takes him to my bathroom, and sucks his dick. I sort of stay neutral (I said, ""I don't endorse it, but if you want to be a slut, it's your call.""), and stay until her mouth is wrapped around his placid slim jim. 
 30 minutes later, he calls me to come back. He says he didn't come so he's not giving her the percocet. So now I have to be a fucking pimp, and tell him, ""Look man, if you didn't come, that's your fault. My girl was on you for 30 minutes. She earned it."" 
 He's like, ""Sure, man, that's cool. You better have some good stuff here. I'll give you a call tomorrow for some more."" 
 ""No way in hell, man."" I say, as he hands me the percocet. 
 ""No hard feelings, bro."" He says, and walks out the door.","I took her away in exchange for agreeing to hook a brother up with headies. He came to get head as well. But he didn't come, so I had to become a pimp to get my slut a percocet."

AskReddit,cmwetsi,"While visiting a friend in San Antonio we were walking around the Blue Star area of the Riverwalk. My friend saw an abandoned warehouse and said ""That looks cool!  I want to go take pictures of the inside."" I told him there was no way I was going into what looked like a death trap and I would wait for him by the fence he would have to climb under. 
 While I was waiting a group of teenage kids came out of a different spot of the fence nearby where I was and then took off running.  A lovely gentlemen walking his pit bull comes tearing up the sidewalk towards me as the kids are running away. As he approaches me he yells ""Hey vato!  You see anybody come out of that building?"".  He is pointing to the building the kids came out of/my friend went into. At this point, I can't help but notice he is covered from head to toe with tattoos, most notably face tattoos that look like clown makeup and an MS-13  neck tattoo. For those of you who don't know the MS-13 is a very large Latino gang with a reputation for being super violent. 
 So back to our little chat now. He is standing two feet away from me while I probably look like a deer caught in headlights. He says ""Hey man!  Don't you hear me talking to you?  Did you see anybody?!"".  At this point he slides his free hand under the back of his shirt and keeps it there.  I can only assume he is holding a  gun, because he does not move his hand one fucking inch after placing it back there, and his gaze is locked on me. 
 I awkwardly respond with ""I  think I saw some kids come out of there.""  He asks me where they went and I point in a direction they didn't go. At this point, I notice my friend is running towards where me and my new friend are. MS-13 man says ""Who is that?"".  I say it is my friend as I start hurriedly walking backwards toward my friend, the whole time never breaking eye contact with the guy and his pit bull. At this point my friend catches up with me and we both take off running in the direction of the parked car, which happens to be in the direction of the MS-13 member, his hand still under his shirt. We run past the guy and he yells ""Come back here vato!  I'm not done talking to you!"". My friend says ""Wandering_geek, that man is yelling at you.""  I respond with ""I know. Keep running!"". 
 We get back to the car and start talking about what went down while driving away. We kept expecting to be shot at any minute. It turns out that my friend had made it to the upper level of this abandoned warehouse and saw a guy yelling at him to run away.  The guy tells him that there was a man with a shotgun upstairs guarding something. So we had unknowingly stumbled across a building where the MS-13 had stashed something valuable and almost got shot in the process. Good times!",My friend and I were almost shot by the MS-13 in San Antonio.

 I was about 17 at the time and it was the morning after I had a massive party with about 20-30 of my friends and we had been drinking on my backyard deck underneath one of those cheap, portable tent/gazebos you can find at Walmart. I came upstairs in search of a glass of water to deal with my massive hangover. This was when I noticed that there was a huge wind/rain/shit storm assaulting my backyard, knocking bottles and tossing around the portable gazebo. 
 As I ran outside to wrestle the gazebo from blowing away, I noticed my neighbour and her boyfriend staring at me from their kitchen window, her boyfriend full out pointing and  laughing  at me. By now the gazebo resembled very little of it's original form and I was being thrashed in the face with heavy rain, wind, and the nylon roof of the gazebo. Enraged at this asshole getting off on such schadefreude, I flipped him the bird and told him to fuck off. 
 I get that it was combination of my loud party and finger gesture that set him over the edge, but there was no way I could have anticipated for what happened next. In the midst of a torrential downpour, he ran outside, climbed over my fence (take note this man is 240+lbs and in his late 50s/early 60s) and began circling me and verbally threatening me ( ""I'll fucking rip off your balls and choke you with them!"" ""Every bottle cap and beer can I find on this side of the fence I'm going to fucking shove up your ass!"" ). Not wanting to underestimate what this guy was capable of I grabbed one of the remaining legs of the gazebo to defend myself while I yelled at my sleeping mother to call the police. Fortunately my neighbour (his girlfriend) was able to calm him down enough before he was able to attack me, but it was still one of the most terrifying things that has ever happened to me. 
 Since then, the story has spread to the rest of the people on my street and he has now become vilified along with my neighbour, and my mum (who used to be best friends with her) still doesn't speak with him.",Neighbour's bf jumped over fence and tried to attack me after I flipped him off for laughing at me trying to secure a gazebo during an intense storm the morning after I had a party.

It turns out that when he propped up his feet that they were pointed at the picture of Thailand's king. In that culture, pointing your feet at someone is the equivalent of giving someone the bird.

AskReddit,c71u2e1,"I am a happily married man.  But before I was married, I was successful with girls.  I was raised by my mom and sisters, which makes talking to girls very easy for me.  Now that I no longer use these skills for my own benefit, I get great satisfaction from being a wingman.  I've even gone so far as to get the fat girl out in the parking lot before telling her, ""Yeah, so, this was just so my buddy could get into your hot friend's pants."" 
 This one is a little involved but works like a champ if correctly executed. 
 Scenario:  you're with a buddy a the bar, he spots his mark, she can be with or without friends (works better with friends).  Now here's the key, you can not be seen planning this out twenty feet away and then try to execute.  Girls are smart, they can smell a rat, so don't mess this up by being a 4th grader, giggling amongst yourselves and then walking over to them. Plan the Work, then Work the Plan. 
 So I walk over, alone, and immediately address the girl in question.  It's difficult to start something from nothing, but the goal here is to catch her attention, and make it obvious you are interested.  Hopefully, you've made her and her friends laugh, removed any fear of being a creeper, learned the importnat facts (single, straight, perhaps dtf) and can execute the next step:  Buy everyone a drink. 
 So now, you've established a few tennants:  you're a nice guy, they (group approval is important) like you, you've bought everyone another round, and perhaps even the girl in question is interested.  When you come back with the drinks, this is the crucial point:  Don't be a dick, but change your attitude.  Not Bi-polar, but rather, show your true colors, i.e. you wanna fuck her brains out and don't give a damn that her friends are present to witness your shameless attempt.  Ignore the fat girl, make an off colored comment (perhaps one about money, race, religion, politics, etc.), and allow the mood to change.  You will see it, you will feel it; the awkwardness should consume your being.  Relish in the silence, for you have done your job. Once this change has occured, the magic is soon to be upon us. 
 Do Not, under any circumstances, signal your buddy.  You're alone, with a group of women, trying to pull one of them away.  The attention is on you, espcially if your doing a convincing job of showing what you really care about is her naked. Therefore, some type of signal, unless very covert (like taking a drink with your left hand as opposed to your right), will be noticed, and the fat lady will then sing the song of her people. 
 He should have been watching, therefore, the mood shift will be noticable.  Your job as wingman is to relentlessly pursue the girl, by any means necessary. Your buddy will then come over, and save the day. 
 He should do and say the following, in this order:  Walk to the group, touch the girl gently on the arm or back, address the group, ""babe, ladies, sorry I'm late, I was caught is some terrible traffic"" If you've done your job, then they will gladly accept the out.  Your role is not done yet, however.  Once you've seen they accept his invitation to get you away, make a small scene.  I prefer, ""What the fuck? I stand here, listen to your stories, talk with your friends, buy everyone drinks, and you've got a boyfriend? I should at least get a blow job out of this.  This is total bullshit."" 
 Walk away, pissed.  He must follow up very quickly with something to the effect of, ""Sorry to butt in like that, I just can't stand guys like that. I'm meeting a buddy fro ahpy hour, and he's not here yet, just thought I could help out.""  he shouldn't walk away immediately, he shouldn't linger either.  Trust me, one of them will invite him to stay, and then he can do his thing.  And because he used his mark as his fake girlfriend to shoo you away, it's already in her mind, no need to exculde the other women from conversation or try to seperate her from the group...yet. 
 I have done this for 5 different guys, it works.  give it a try.  For bonus points, it works extremely well for military vets in uniforms (I do not have any idea why they seem to be so successful, but both of my recently retired militray buds have had a 100% success rate).","chat up a group of girls, buy everyone a round, be a little bit of a dick, and ultimately let your buddy save the day."

AskReddit,c1ybrz5,"One night, I woke up alarmed and got fully awake immediately, which normally doesn't happen to me. There was no loud sound, I didn't need to pee and I didn't feel any pain or physical discomfort. It seemed I woke up for no reason. I just felt a sudden urge to move my arm, on which I happened to be lying - it was as if my life depended on moving my arm. 
 No way! It was completely paralysed and I had no feeling in it. I wouldn't have noticed if someone had chopped it off. I turned over a bit and used my other arm to move the ""dead"" one. It was weird, because it (the ""dead"" arm) felt like a piece of meat never attached to my nervous system. Finally, I managed to move it (""omfg! my arm is so heavy!"") and I let it hang down from the bed. All this happened in a moment, in fact. 
 Then, blood started gradually returning into my veins. This was a very specific, weird and horrible physical sensation - I'd have preferred just to feel normal, familiar pain. When my arm resurrected, I felt asleep again. If I hadn't woken up in the middle of the night but had slept until the morning with virtually no blood circulation in my arm, I'd have had a huge problem. I'm sure at least some of my cells would have died.","I was sleeping lying on my arm, which stopped blood circulation and left my arm completely numb. Despite feeling no kind of physical discomfort, I woke up panicked, instinctively did what I needed to do to restore my blood circulation and saved my arm."
AskReddit,cr8mx7c,"So I'll preface this by saying that it had been a very long shift. We had been running calls all day long. Literally, back to back, without any chance for lunch or dinner. Around 8pm we were on the way back from the hospital back to the firehouse and just flat refused to put ourselves back in service until we stopped at Sonic and grabbed food. Which we did. We get back to the firehouse and grab the food, step halfway out of the ambulance extremely excited to eat. Then the pager goes off again. It's a request from the police to help them pick up a rather obese gentleman. 
 Whatevs. It's just a pick up, we can put him in his bed and be back at the station in 20 minutes. 
 So we close the door and just take off without ever getting out. The sweet aroma of so many tater tots and a sweet, juicy double bacon cheeseburger filled the cab. It was just about to send me in to an epileptic apoplexy when we got to the guy's house. I called us on scene, and we got out of the ambulance. 
 This particular shift was myself and my usual partner, as well as a volunteer who was hanging out with us that day. I'm not a big guy by any means, but my partner was rather built. The volunteer was just a young girl. 
 Anyways, on to the story. We walk in and I'm immediately overpowered by the smell of so much shit. Like, I expected it to be smeared all over the walls it smelled so bad. We were just through the garage door in the living room, though, and so we didn't see anyone. I said ""fire department"" really loud, and the cops shouted back for us to come down the hallway. I turned around the corner and saw the two cops. One had just the biggest shit eating grin you ever saw, and the other was half vomiting in his mouth. Then I hear a voice say ""HEY GUYS!"" It was rather cheery, and so I look down towards the source to see the patient's head sticking out of the door. Fair enough. 
 As we went down the hallway the smell became rather unbearable, but still no sign of shi... nope. Found it. He was on the floor in the bathroom. Now try to picture this. A roughly 600lb, butt naked man, lying face up and in about two and a half inches of a sea of liquid shit. It covered the whole bathroom floor. Well, so much for the easy out. 
 My partner and I have had it with calls and just want to go. I look at him and he says ""screw it, let's just haul him up."" He gets down, grabs the guy under his arms, and tries to pick him up. He succeeds in trying too hard for nothing, and smearing poop all over his shirt and pants. He sort of muttered something to himself, then said ""I'll get the backboard, be right back."" The volunteer said ""I'll do the paperwork, hehehe!"" and disappeared. 
 I noticed it was taking my partner a while to come back, so I peeked out the front window in the living room and sure enough - he's vomiting all over the side of the ambulance. Then grabs the backboard and walks back in. 
 Now, in order to lift someone up with a backboard you have to slide it under them, then balance them as they are stood up. My partner being the burliest, he's going to be standing behind the guy to push up. That means I get to wade in to the Brown Sea and make sure he doesn't fall forward. Screw it, that's why they give us boots! 
 But wait. As we start to ratchet him up inch by inch, that's when I realize - this is a 600lb man who couldn't stand up. What if he falls forward? I am not big enough to hold him straight. He will fall right on me, and I will die smothered by a smelly 600lb man and drowning in his liquid shit. The fear rises with every inch we bring him higher, until finally he is standing upright. We walk him back, and as we get to the door I can see that maybe, just maybe, God is going to spare me from my shittastic fate. Then we hear a voice from beyond the distance - ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"" 
 The caretaker had finally appeared from whatever corner of the house he was hiding in. We weren't allowed to bring him out of the bathroom until he had put down towels, presumably to spare the carpet from poop. The fear begins to rise once more. I'm still wading through the Brown Sea, and a metric ton of death is starting to wobble. He tosses down some towels, grabs a walker, and we finally get him out of the bathroom. 
 I kneel down to make sure the walker legs are stable, and my partner rests the guy on the walker. Mission success. Then I look up, I lock eyes with this man, and he moans ""Awww, I'm gonna go again..."" and I look down to see Niagra Falls flowing down his leg. It splashes all over the towels. The caretaker moves in right away to start wiping off his leg, and finally, karma strikes back - a last spurt of poo erupts from McPoopy's anus and on to the caretaker's face. Make me stand in the shit... hahaha! 
 Anyways, we get the guy back to his bed, lay him down, and sign him off. He really doesn't want to go to the hospital, even though really he should - and don't get me wrong, hungry or not, we would gladly take him. We get back in the ambulance. 
 At this point, I'm pretty much covered in shit. My partner is doubly covered in shit. The volunteer is shit-free, but fuck her - she has to smell all that shit. We stopped at my partner's house on the way back so he could grab another uniform. I had one still at the firehouse. While he was out, I remembered how hungry I was. I looked down at the bag of Sonic. I looked away. 
 I looked again. 
 I looked away.","got covered in shit, ate my Sonic covered in shit because fuck you, I'm hungry."

AskReddit,cdpihl9,"My grandfather was feared by our community, had three mistresses on the side. My grandmother was one of them. She had my uncle when she was 19, my mother when she was 21. He died when my mother was 10 months old of a heart attack in the house I was raised in, but I just found that out recently. He was married the entire time and she knew about the other women and children, so did their kids. He was born in 1895 and my grandmother was born in 1941. He was a friend of her father. My grandmother refused to discuss the entire thing the rest of her life and I'm still trying to put the pieces together... 
 My mother and her last boyfriend before my father, along with two friends, were drug dealers. Her friend sold acid and everything like that, while my mom and her best friend tended to do more just pot. Since the police officers back then were all male, they'd never get searched and would sneak TONS of stuff into concerts and events. Liquor, weed, acid, etc. Never got caught; likes to tell me the story of the first time she did acid and drove but stopped, but she kept  moving ... 
 My mother also hooked up with my bio-dad, a repeat felon and drug dealer and gang member, wife beater, etc., about that time. I was an accident so she stopped doing drugs and drinking after finding out about me. ""Daddy"" confronted my mother a few weeks before I was born, demanding that she marry him because that was the right thing to do. When she told him no, he stole a car and drove through two states before getting caught. Needless to say, he was in jail for quite a while... 
 Bio-dad was arrested as a teenager for DUI then got his second DUI within 10 days of the last one. He drives a moped now. Then the Grand Theft Auto story above, and he eventually got out. Proceeded to get married a handful of times--he was already married and divorced with two kids by the time my mom came around--and had one more son. Last wife he and her got wasted and he proceeded to beat the living shit out of her. As the paper explained the scene, there were lines from her fingers digging into the floor where a large pool of blood was from him dragging her out the door. He tried to bribe her with a camper trailer for her not to testify when he was in jail... 
 Next would be the my mother getting back with him after 24 years, sleeping with him the first night, moving into his camper trailer that had no electricity and still has no running water. They've been living there, on his parents' property, for a few years now. He beats her, she hides the bruises and makes up stories. Tried to get her to leave to no avail. She basically told me if I don't like it, I don't have to have anything to do with them, so we don't... 
 My husbands' father they're pretty sure his father was actually his dad's brother. The time line doesn't fit for the war and it's the opposite with his cousin, who seems to have his father. So, basically, the brothers were bangin' one another's wife's... 
 He's [FIL] also crazy as fuck and we had to get a restraining order against him. He was stalking us online and off, threatening us via text, email and voicemail, then would just act like nothing happened. He's convinced his friends and family that we're just lying, but if anyone would like to look at all the paperwork and proof we had to submit to get an order against him, you'd understand. It's scary and he even flipped out in court which certainly didn't help... 
 Oh yeah, and my great uncle--I always called and considered him an uncle--killed his son-in-law and daughter before killing himself 10 years ago this month. They were fighting over the grandson and my uncle shot the guy in the eye, he lived for a day, and accidentally shot his daughter in the process. The nearly one-year-old baby was there when it happened and he just scooped him up and walked over to his mother-in-laws (through his wife) and explained what happened before heading back to his house and blowing his brains out with a shotgun. My aunt had that house cleaned and lived in it for a while, then the house that her daughter died in. Thing that freaks me out was how her [my aunt] mother described not believing what he had said and finding the guy in the floor in the kitchen, then calling for my cousin and trying to push open the bedroom door, but it was stuck. She went outside to the window and saw her leaning forward against the door standing there, but she was dead. She'd been shot between the eyes I think, then must have stumbled back and closed the door somehow. I don't know, but I can't get that image out of my head...","My family is ten shades of fucked the hell up.

He was also a kidney and liver transplant recipient. When I first saw the patient I told my superiors that he that he was so ill he should be in ICU, but they felt differently. 
 We had him on a nasogastric tube feed regimen, but this had to be stopped overnight because he was supposed to undergo a gastric tube placement the next day. The next morning I came in and found him unresponsive. I got the nurse to do a glucose meter check and he had a blood glucose of  17  (70-100 would be normal). We gave him glucose and I realized then that the guy's liver had been too compromised and he had been too low on energy stores (duh, in retrospect) to maintain his own blood glucose level, and I  should've  placed him on a IV dextrose drip overnight in addition to the saline he was getting.

 So my friend and I went for a surf and we spent the whole morning in the water. Surfing the whole day made us hungry and my friend kept harping on about this bowl of fruit he has at home we can dig into. The dude was really looking forward to that fruit.

We seniors began noticing that the stuffing in one of the couches was coming out. Now, I like to think that this happened slowly, over a long time, with people absent-mindedly picking at the stuffing while waiting for fourth period to start, and that it was no one's intent to ruin our beloved lounge. This, however, was not our Vice-Principal's interpretation. 
 When faculty noticed the torn couch cushion, our VP freaked out. He called every senior into an assembly to let us know how disappointed he was in the person who would vandalize our lounge. He said that (actual words), ""we weren't thinking of the couch's feelings,"" and until the guilty person came forward he would suspend every single senior's lunch privileges. 
 We were pissed. So pissed. The couch's condition obviously wasn't an act of vandalism but, most likely normal wear and tear and, at its worst, careless, absent-minded foolishness on the part of a bunch of students. And to use the accusation of us not caring about the feelings of an inanimate object as a reason to punish us? We had to do something. 
 Some friends and I bought tee shirts for every senior and wrote ""I CARE ABOUT THE COUCH"" in giant black letters. The next day every senior wore one, and, during our lunch period, we all sat on the front lawn of the school and ate a pot luck lunch together. We told the VP that we'd be doing it every day until the punishment was lifted. We won.","Vice-Principal accused the seniors of couch-rape, we fought back with a solidarity protest."
AskReddit,c2ybcie,"I had a some-what not so similar story to this one. My friend and I were the only two sober people at a party we were at, so my drunken friend told us to take her car to pick up weed. So my friend and I drove about 30 minutes to go get free weed from the guy that a girl at the party was seeing. Turns out, he didn't want to just give us weed, so he smoked us down. So us freaking out realizing hey, we need to bring something back for our friends, we decide to make a stop at my car which was on the way back to the party to pick up a gram that was in my car. As we pull into this neighborhood, a cop follows us in. Its about 3 30 in the morning, we were out past curfew, and high as hell. 
 Me, being high, decides it'd be a great idea to pull into a dead end street, where the cop immediately follows me. Me, being high, also decides that it'd be a great idea to turn the car off and throw the keys out the window before the cop pulls us over (which actually ended up saving our asses) so i turn the car off and the cop pulls us over. He comes up to the car and asks why we were here, I said i was getting my keys from my friends car. The cop simply states that there is no registration sticker on the license plate and asks us to get out the registration. As i open the glove box, our bowl rolllls out onto the floor. The cop didn't say one word about it. He took the registration sticker, put it on the license plate and told us to have a safe night. 
 turns out he couldn't write us any sort of driving ticket or anything, since i turned off the car before he turned on his lights?  i guess its my daughter of a lawyer instincts or something.",Got high. Cop followed me. Turned off car before he pulled me over. He couldn't write me a ticket.

I awkwardly said ""thanks, but no thanks,"" and walked away... as I was walking to the back room, I was intercepted by the son (fun fact: he was in a batman t-shirt) and he basically reiterated what his mother said.. he thought I was attractive and he would love to take me to dinner or for drinks.

AskReddit,c2c1l8w,"When I was about 10 years old, my family went to the colorado river with another family.  The other family brought their boat for water skiing.  One night my Dad and our family friend, Jeff, were going to do some night time catfishing.  I convinced them to take me with them so I didn't have to hang out with all the women.  Since this was the mid 80's, my Dad and Jeff were getting pretty tipsy while they fished.  Around mid-night one of the lines just starts reeling out.  The reel is screaming when my Dad picks it up and goes to set the hook.  Once the hook is set, my Dad starts fighting this fish.  After about 30-45 minutes, the fish appears to be tiring.  Jeff starts maneuvering the boat to help my Dad land this fish. 
 This where the story gets wierd. Just as my Dad gets the fish about 20 feet from the boat, the fish takes off again.  It runs the line all the way down to the reel.  My Dad had anticipated catching large cat fish and was using his deep sea gear.  We then realize the fish is pulling the boat backwards.  Not at a rapid pace; but, still backwards.  Jeff gives the boat a little more throttle and the fish fights more and we're in a stale mate tug-of-war.  Finally we hear Jeff say that the boat is full throttle and fish starts pulling us backward again.  After about 5 minutes of this, my Dad cut the line and we limped the boat, half rowing and half under motor power, back to camp.  To this day, no one believes us.  They say my Dad and Jeff were just drunk.  Here's the thing, I remember this and I was 10.  I wasn't drunk.  Scared the shit out of me though.  To this day, I hate the idea of swimming in the colorado river.

The lights were on, the dogs were barking, yet still no one comes to the door. I didn't have his number, but I kept messaging him on the app. No response there either. 
 Suddenly, some drunk guy standing outside a bar down the street starts yelling to me ""hey! That's my house!!"" At this point, I'm thinking ""fuck fuck fuck, is this the guy?"" I walk towards the guy. As I get closer, I can start to make out his face; he was about in his late fifties, but the guy I was meeting was 24. ""Oh god,"" I'm thinking. 
 ""I'm looking for Lew, do you know where I can find him?"" I ask. This poor drunk guy stares at me for a moment, confused. I was pretty sure I'd been played at that point, but then he goes ""ohhhh, Lew! Yeah! He's not answering his phone?"" At this point, he invites me in the house, and is telling me all about Lew. Apparently this was his step dad and he didn't even live there, but he gave me the guy's number and waits while I call him. No answer. 
 Then I text him ""LEW ANSWER THE PHONE YOU FUCK"" at which point the fucker finally replies asking who it is and I tell him. THEN he calls me back and I tell him ""I'm in your living room with Marty(the step dad), meeting your cats(there were cats everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE)"". He tells me he'll be right there. So while I wait, Marty is slurring along, telling me how he married Lew's mom, and how Lew's a good kid, etc. Finally the dude shows up.

AskReddit,cdzrnul,"Not mine, but a friend of mine and I were at a big house party during our freshman year. House parties are notorious for running out of toilet paper. 
 The night starts after a hearty meal of rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy - the works. We're getting ready to leave and my friend is complaining of gas saying she doesn't want to go out. I tell her that no one will notice if she happens to crop-dust the dance floor and that she'll be fun. 
 About an hour later we're at the party having a few beers when she grabs a group of us for the typical female bathroom rendezvous. 5 or so of us pile into the bathroom as my flatulent friend takes a seat. Too tipsy to realize what had just happened, we start telling her to hurry up so we can get out of the bathroom. I told her we needed to leave and the look on her face was that of sheer terror. 
 Frantically she started searching for anything to wipe with. Wondering why she was being so dramatic, I just told her ""oh come on, drip dry and let's go!"" She rummages under the sink and grabs the empty plastic bag that once contained the toilet paper. We were beginning to grow impatient with her antics and forced her to stand and leave the bathroom.

AskReddit,c3i4pez,"When my grandpa was dying in hospice, my aunt, uncle, mom, grandma, brother and sister in law all piled into his room and sat around him and focused our attention on him, how he was, when he needed more morphine, etc. We hugged him and held his hand, kissed his head, told him we loved him. Basically, we were wallowing. 
 A day before he died, my brother and I realised that my grandpa would have been pissed if he knew all we were doing was sitting around being sad. He loved to laugh and no one was laughing.
So we found the 1989 oakland A's world series on my brother's phone and we streamed it through the hospice room television. We sat around and talked about normal things. That night, my brother and I came back with the movie Up! We watched it in his room with my aunt.  We really felt that he was happier with us just being there, doing normal things, including him instead of doting on him. 
 I feel that for my grandpa, it was comforting for him to see and feel that life was still being life, even though his own was expiring. I look back over those days and wish we had been more normal. He hung on for a long period of time, and I just feel he was looking for reassurance that his family would still be ok if he was gone, and us hanging over the side of the bed in grief did not express that we were fine at all. 
 I had to get on a plane to fly home the day he died. I came down for 4 days to be with him. My mom, brother and sister in law were in the car taking me to the airport. Back at hospice, my step dad, grandma and aunt remained. My aunt had fallen asleep in a chair and my grandma suddenly wanted to go for a stroll around the yard so my step dad took her out. Within minutes, my grandpa passed. It was really like he waited for everyone to leave. 
 What I regret, other than living 700 miles away the last 3 years of his life, is not being around him MORE when he was aware that we were there for him. I regret not being able to say how much I loved him while I still knew he could comprehend. Before he went into hospice, he was staying in a regular hospital. He hated it. All he wanted to do was go home. He wanted people to stay with him. I wish someone would have then, when he was asking for it, instead of when he had lost his spark and his body and mind retreated and began preparing to die. 
 I don't think there's a way to brace yourself. Death is so uncontrollably infuriating. We're so helpless and vulnerable. We are powerless. Be with your family. Heal from each other. Don't hold back your words. 
 The things you do for a dying loved one are not necessarily just for the infirm. We get them balloons, stuffed animals and flowers trying to make them feel better - but they're dying - we're trying to make ourselves feel better with those things. Our brains don't handle death very well. Because our brains aren't dying. 
 I'm sorry I'm rambling, I'm remembering my grandpa and that stressful time in my life. I flew down to be with my grandpa before he died, along with that load, 2 hours after my plane landed my dad had a stroke. That was not a fun week. 
 Brace yourself with the knowledge that you love your sister not just because she's dying, but because of the person she is, and the person she's helped you become. Your life and the life of your family and your continued happiness truly means that her life will never really end. Please make memories, please don't be afraid to cry. Brace yourself by knowing how loved your sister feels. Brace yourself by knowing that everyone did what they could to make her comfortable. Laugh. Please don't feel bad to make jokes and laugh about things, especially once she does pass. Remember ALL sorts of experiences, good and bad - because good and bad experiences make us human. Don't take away her humanity just because it might be an unpleasant memory. Remember the times she pissed you off! It's SO important. Never forget that people love to laugh. 
 Please take care of yourself and don't ignore your own human and emotional needs. You are so vitally important to your sister, don't take yourself for granted - I'm sure she wouldn't. Everything you are feeling is completely valid. 
 Be the love you want your sister to feel before she dies. What we do for ourselves is almost as important as what we do for them. By the end, their brains don't want comforting - ours do. I hope you get that comfort.","you can't brace yourself, so don't stop acting like a normal person, normalcy - even feigned - is vital to not losing your mind."

 Don't bother. Firstly, this is not the middle ages and you do not need the blessing of someones father to date their daughter. It helps if you are on friendly terms with parents, yes, but it is not neccesary. 
 Secondly, I have never gone out of my way to please a partners parents. The way I did it was simple: I was the person their child loved. Thats it. If you are making their child happy they should like you by default. If you are compromising on who you are just to try and please someone chances are you won't please them.

He said he ""Respected"" me, we had plenty of interesting conversations and I spent a rather happy Christmas with them. 
 He knew I was left wing. If I had bent over backwards to please him he would have had no respect for him, I would have been far more insufferable than the liberal his daughter was dating.","If you are having to ask how to please the parents of your partner you should probably quit the dating pool for a while.

AskReddit,cdfjilb,"Ok. So here's the worst one of them I think. Sadly it's not the last one because we still hung out for a couple weeks after this. 
 I have this longtime platonic friend. Anyone who knows us knows that there is nothing at all going on romantically. This friend was at the time engaged to a horrible horrible girl. I hated this girl, everyone did. I was just the most vocal. 
 One night we were hanging out with 2 of my friends and we were at a diner after a night of drinking and I got up to go to the bathroom. I came back, and he immediately got up to go too. I sat down and my friends said as soon as I walked away he started grilling them about me being in love with my friend. Their only response to him was, ""No, she's not, but we definitely are not comfortable with you asking us these questions about her."" I felt so terrible. We had all ridden together, and after we left they dropped me and him off at my apartment. 
 We got out of the car, and I asked him why he would do that. We started arguing and I asked him to keep his voice down until we got inside. He was screaming at me in the elevator and all down the halls and I was begging him to shut up cause it was the middle of the night and I never wanted to be ""that girl"". 
 First he completely admitted that he did it and I was his girlfriend and he had the right. After a bit of arguing he tried to say that he didn't say it. I reminded him of how he admitted it, and he said that he did say it, but they took it out of context. I reminded him again of what he had already said, and he changed it to ""Well, I did, but it's ok because they completely put my fears to rest."" Somehow them changing the subject and refusing to say anything made him believe I didn't have feelings for this guy. 
 So by now it's early morning and I'm so angry and I just really hate this guy. He didn't have a car (he lived in the city and didn't need one, I lived just outside in the burbs), so I had to drive his ass home. I was completely sober by this point, he was still a hot mess. 
 We are in the car and we're screaming at each other. Like we've been resenting each other for years level. And finally I just say, ""It doesn't matter, I'm done. We aren't dating. As soon as you get out of my car, we never have to deal with this again. There's no reason to fight for 4 hours when in another 15 minutes, we can just be strangers again."" He got really quiet and said, ""If that's true, I don't know what I will do. I will hurt myself."" And I just very calmly said, ""Only you are responsible for your actions. I can only control what I do."" To which he quickly changed his tune and said he would never hurt himself. By now we are outside his building (same address as me for those keeping track at home) and he won't get out of the car. He's just sitting there holding his stupid bathrobe and all the other crap he had ""left behind"" at my place refusing to get out of the car. He's begging me to come inside and I was just so tired. I finally convinced him by promising we could talk the next day. He got out of the car, went to close the door, and threw something back in the car. I don't remember what it was. Concert tickets or something. He had bought it and I told him I wasn't going to go with him anymore, but he wouldn't take the tickets back. He said I could give them back next time I saw him and I wanted to be like, ""THIS IS THE LAST TIME EVER"" but I didn't want him getting back in the car. 
 Sooooo. The next day he calls, terribly upset, and basically blamed the entire mess on his inability to mix pot and alcohol. Offered to apologize to my friends, promised never to smoke pot around me. And like an idiot, I rationalized it away. I rationalized all this shit away. And now I'm repeating all the stories and remembering how this all happened in the span of 2 months and it's nuts. When we did break up (about 2 weeks after this), telling the stories all in a row was so embarrassing. Now I'm in a really good relationship with a stable guy and it's funny.","Guy freaks out, tries every tactic to make it work, lasted another 2 weeks."

These 2 guys were best friends all growing up.  One night, one of the guys came out to the 2 girls, and said he has had a crush on his best friend (other guy) for years.

 Mourning sucks. I lost my boyfriend (years ago) and it wasn't the same type of situation, but death and grieving just plain blow. I can't imagine adding possible feelings of guilt on top of that. The issue with grieving is that it all depends on the individual. 
 For example, when my boyfriend died I was devastated. What do people do for that? What do I do for that? I wanted to be alone, people didn't want me to be alone, I secretly loved that they cared enough for me to stick around yet hated that they wouldn't let me grieve by myself. 
 One day I needed to go get an outfit for the funeral. My bestie took me to the store and you know what? It was the most normal relieving afternoon of that entire situation. I even laughed at one point and it felt really fucking good. I think the irony here is that if she had suggested we go out to get my mind off of things I would have been offended. I'm so easily distracted from the loss of my love? Yet having it happen naturally...organically. That was what made it so nice.

AskReddit,ckfnuug,"I worked with mentally disabled people for over a year. Lots of great stories that had me crying with laughter by the time I'd relay it to family, lots of terrible, head-ache induced ones, too. The person I have the most stories with though, is a middle aged woman I'll call ""Jess"". 
 Jess was one of the most difficult people to work with. She had a disorder called Polydipsia - Basically, if she saw a beverage she'd compulsively drink it. Literally anything. She can't control it, but at the same time she didn't want to. Well, she COULD control it if she really wanted to (AKA bribing her to do her favorite things) but often times it was a lost cause. She was EXTREMELY OCD as well as had Autism. She also had a terrible temper and would chase/hit/yell at people so many didn't want to work with her. I did well with her though, so I was always put on shifts with her because for some reason she really liked me. 
 Anyway, the one time I considered punching someone in the face was when I was with Jess. She had an obligation to walk/do some kind of exercise once per day which she absolutely hated. However, she liked the mall a lot so I was able to convince her to walk with me for a half hour, and I would reward her by letting her look at magazines (She LOVED magazines). 
 So one day we're doing our walk when I hear some woman yelling after me ""EXCUSE me! EXCCUUSSEE me!"" I turned around, surprised and the woman at the kiosk comes storming up to me and Jess. 
 ""Can I help you?"" I asked her. She looked from me to Jess, glaring at her as she did. 
 She explained to me that Jess had been there the day before which I knew wasn't possible because I had taken her to the YMCA to do Zumba. I tried to explain to her but she kept cutting me off. She told me it was at around one when Jess had come by their kiosk and stolen a drink that had been laying around. She had drank all of it and the woman wanted compensation for it for the employee Jess had taken it from. 
 I hadn't been with her in the afternoon the day before so I turned to her and asked, ""Jess, were you at the Mall yesterday?"" she looked down and mumbled yes and told me she had been at her day ""job"" (Which is just at the center where she does crafts/whatever to occupy her time). 
 ""What is that?!"" snapped the woman. I turned to her and gently explained what it was, that I was sorry this had happened, and informed her about Jess's condition. I also told her I was sorry but I hadn't brought money so if she wanted compensation we'd have to come back later. The woman sniped, ""Well YOU shouldn't have to pay for it!"" I agreed and told her Jess would pay for it out of her funds and that this was sort of common (this drink cost 2 fucking dollars - come ON lady!). 
 The lady looks away from me and starts badgering Jess, saying things like, ""You KNOW what you did!"" ""You did something BAD didn't you? HUH?"" and I was slowly getting angry so I jumped in, saying sharply, ""Ma'am, she is my participant and what you are doing is inappropriate. You do not know her condition. I understand you're upset but we will take care of it."" The woman glares at me and goes back to berating Jess, talking to her like she's - well - mentally disabled and sub-human which anyone in the business can tell you is EXTREMELY rude and unnecessary. I figured she was treating me like an ignorant shit-head because I was young (only 21) so she probably thought she could take advantage of me and Jess. 
 I was done the minute she said, ""Do you UNDERSTAND what I'm saying? Do you know ENGLISH?"" I move Jess aside, step in front of her and tell the woman, ""You know what? We're done here. You can get your money, but I won't condone you talking down to her anymore. Goodbye."" I take Jess and we walk, the woman says something to our backs but I ignore her because I am about two seconds away from going ape shit on this ignorant bitch. 
 So we walk the mall some more and pass the woman a few times. She glares at us and starts talking shit to employees in other kiosks. She also points and laughs at us. 
 So the next day I called the company she worked for, made a huge stink about how someone that ignorant and shitty shouldn't be suited to work for the general public if she doesn't understand mental disabilities and treats people like monkeys (before I could give her name they said ""Oh, we know her and have gotten complaints in the past"") and the next week, she wasn't there anymore.","A shitty person yelled at my participant over a 2 dollar drink. 
 A FUNNY story is one time while doing Zumba with Jess, I looked over at her, saw her plugging her nose and fanning her ass so I knew she farted and it must have smelled. I look behind her to see the shocked faces of two woman as they tried to (inconspicuously) plug their noses."

 Then the stripper came... we were suddenly 18. I proceeded to lick the sweet chocolate sauce of guilt off of her nipples while trying to hide that awkward boner cause she was grinding all over me. I so badly wanted her to get off of me or else she'd feel my boner and think I was gross. yeah.

Since this experience has been burned into my brain, I don't think I'll ever forget it. It is buried away in the scar tissue it has created in my brain. ""But Gravee, it can't be that bad, can it?"" Oh it was bad! It was...apocalyptic! I barely escaped with my life, let alone my 12 items or less. 
 Lets start off with the fact that I was nearly killed 3 times pulling into the parking lot. Pulling INTO the freakin' lot! I finally found a spot in section 23 row 81. I rigged my car with a remote controlled signal flare to find my car when I finally made it out. I watched in horror as hundreds of thousands of people were herded into the entrance of Satan's Vacation Home like cattle being driven to the slaughter house. I second-guessed my choice to enter this Hell-on-earth. I should've listened to my instincts. 
 I end up walking across the parking lot being shoved and pushed the whole way (I think I even saw a few people crowd surfing). I had sudden flashbacks of ""The War of The Worlds"" movie and prayed there weren't tripods waiting to scoop us up and turn us into more Super Wal-Marts. I've almost made it inside...but wait, I see the 94 year old woman at the front door is bending over to pick up a smushed french fry off the floor. There was nothing I could do for her. Poor thing never knew what hit her. 
 At this point I'm inside and have managed to fight off 12 people who speak no English from my shopping cart with loogies and crucifixes. Time to get a map. ""Map? Hah...Hey Marty, this guy wants a map"" ""What a loser, haha."" ""Fag."" GD it. Seeing as how I was there to buy Christmas presents, I decide to go to the universal gift section... DVDs. What the fuck was I thinking?! What the fuck was every foreigner in Colorado thinking? I'm not being racist. Okay, maybe a little, but I'm just exaggerating... But what is it about DVDs that attracts people who don't speak English, smell of alcohol, and have 22 kids that run around screaming, playing a wicked game of ""Frogger"" with carts as they dart across the aisles? I got the eff out as soon as I could... which was about 10 minutes, no joke. 
 I decided to head to the sporting goods section. But I didn't know (I would if I had a map, dammit) that between the DVDs and the sporting goods was the toy section. Who the fuck designed these damn retail roach motels anyway? I nearly clipped a kid on the heel as I sped through the cross aisle of the toy section, instead I tipped my cart over and fell on top of it. You know why? Because some idiot decided it would be a good idea to put ""brakes"" on the carts. Can you guess what their idea of brakes is? A metal bar that goes across the back-right wheel of the carts. So when I grabbed my cart to slow it down, it tipped back and the ""brake"" caught and the whole damn cart fell over taking me with it. I guess I can take solace knowing that the kid I nearly broke my neck for is now on the floor laughing at me. Hahahahah...you gunky! 
 Sporting goods...finally. Suddenly I realize this isn't the best place to be. They sell guns in the sporting goods department. Damn. In my Resident Evil-esque dash out of sporting goods I somehow managed to end up in the seasonal ""Christmas gift section"" of the Human Grinder that is Super Wal-Mart. Can I please catch a break? I swear, I've never seen so many people fighting over crappy off-brand perfume and cheap watches. It was like being at a Backyard Wrestling Royal Rumble... but with presents. I fought my way through the forest of hands that reminded me of the scene in Matrix: Revolutions where that chick is crawling to get away from the sentinels and their tentacles are slamming down missing her by inches...only this time there were Rockin' Rudolphs, talking deer trophys, and fish plaques that sing and dance. I still can't decide which situation I would face if I ever had to choose. 
 It's at about this time that I've gotten all I care to buy. So time to head to the checkout. I swear I hit the back wall twice before I found it. This particular Wal-Mart has 34 checkout lanes, swear to fucking God. They have 12 open. Normally 12 is probably enough. But today is different. I look at the closest line and count 8 people, all with carts filled to the brim. So then I say to myself ""There must be an express lane."" But then my heart sank as I realized those 8 people were  in  the express lane. I decide to seek out a faster checkout lane. I probably walked for about 5 minutes looking for another lane... and moved about 15 feet. About 25 minutes later I find a checkstand with 3 people with carts half-full (or were they half empty? Hmm...) and a Speedy Gonzales cashier. I get in the line. Just when it was looking up for me... sigh  I guess it's the cashier's break time because another guy comes to relieve her...and it's none other than Speedy's cousin Slow-Poke Rodriguez. Fuck! The cart in front of me has a DVD that won't scan. He tries it like 20 times before deciding he better go get a price check. There's some good news. I remember how long it took me to get out of the DVD section and how far away it was. After 15 minutes of waiting, the managers decide to send a ""search party"" for the cashier (no joke, that's what they called it). Finally, they all come back with bruises, cuts and a price. Yes, it's my turn to checkout! I'm on my way out! Yes! My DVD doesn't scan? NO! NOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOO! (""Where is the cashier? Is he alright? Is he safe?"" ""It appears in your anger, you killed him"" ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"")  sigh  ""It's $5.50,"" I say. ""You sure?"" ""Do you really want to go back out there?"" The cashier clutches his ribs. ""Um...$5.50"" That's right, buddy. It's $5.50. Now let me get out of here. 
 So I take my bags, put them in my cart, and head for the exit. Could it really be that easy? Haha...no. Of course I have to set off the alarm. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some freakishly old lady strip search me because something beeped, so I make a run for it. Now...where the fuck did I park?",The moral of the story? Trust your instincts and never enter a Super Wal-Mart. Ever.
AskReddit,cn7iofh,"Yes there is. But like all ways of making money, it is hard work. 
 The options are limitless, but it helps to narrow down what you are willing to do. 
 Another hindrance is the amount you have to put in first. There is either the cost of your time and attention, or the cost of your money. 
 One way I make a few extra bucks online is through buying things on Craigslist that are listed as used or broken, and I try to renovate or repair the item ( I have a background in electronics which helps), and turn around and list the item back on Craigslist, or eBay, and I sell to the highest bidder. It is a lot of work, as most of my free time is spent doing this. But I make an extra $100-$300 a month depending on what the item is. But keep in mind I have to spend the money first, use up my time and resources, and resell it based on my experience on what I think I should earn. Sometimes I don't make as much, sometimes I sell at a loss ( just to get rid of the item), or I end up donating to goodwill (tax deductions at the very least).","there is, but it requires work just like anything else involving earning/getting money."

The thing is, many people simply do not identify with the gender they were assigned along with their sex. It's not that uncommon and it happens all over the world. 
The point is that it is clearly a fact of life that not everyone identifies with their assigned gender, just as not everyone is attracted to people of the opposite gender. So when you scoff at the idea of gender being defined by something other than ""objective reality"" what you actually mean is that  sex  is objective, although with the amount of medical procedures available, chromosomes don't always define a whole lot about someone, even physically. 
So if you keep in mind that gender is more or less a shared set of cultural preconceptions that vary wildly from society to society and that sex is nothing more than a physical state that can be altered, I really don't see an argument against trans people really ""being"" the gender they feel they are that isn't just transphobic bullshit.","Sex, defined as the chromosomes a person has, is fixed. Gender is not."
AskReddit,cqe5wcc,"This happened 4 years ago when our class had 'groups' that is some consisted of the popular kids some consisted of the introverts me being in them , the thing was the popular ones were really mean to me , they thought I was a weirdo because I always had asthma and mucus problems (nose always blowing because the place was too polluted and gave me allergy troubles all the time) , I didn't give a shit and was happy to myself , because they were so rude to me I never talked to them or interacted with them I was happy with myself , so as we go to a higher class the teacher shuffles the students 
 so first, this girl is forced to sit with me ( I wasn't very good looking and I kinda liked her ) , as she walks up to my desk she says ""can you please sit somewhere else""  then as I start to walk away the teacher says "" get_shrekd why are you changing desks I put your seat with girl X as a permanent seat"" X -  loudly  "" I will not sit with him he is a weirdo""   I shrug my shoulders and move over , the teacher is in silence , as the shuffling goes on the teacher who is trying to disperse the popular kids so they don't disturb other kids , tells the most popular of the group (who in her eyes is the most  responsible and less likely to create a ruckus) to sit with me ,  (calling him Y) as  he walks up to my desk he makes a disgusted face and loudly says to his friends ""at least you got a decent person to sit with"" he sits with me and moves to the very end of his chair almost falling off ,all the people around me are staring at him as he makes this big show of being disgusted , I was so mortified after that day I got home and couldn't sleep at night , I cried to myself for weeks after that day and I'm still scared of someone shaming me publicly for no reason ,the memory still haunts me to date , and the worst part is that no one follows their permanent seats till the next period so they created all this ruckus just for sitting with me for the next 20 mins  and this even shocked the teacher after the period she asked me if everything was alright and I didn't want to appear weak in front of her so I just told her that I don't care about these people",I got shunned two times in 30 mins by the girl i liked and a popular person who created a ruckus because they were being forced to sit with me

AskReddit,c2mmpw6,"So when you're attending college and apply for financial aid (from the government) there are a lot of types of aid. Certain types of loans and also grants (obviously the best kind since there's no payback at all). However, what you qualify for is based on your Annual income. The catch, though, is that when you're under 24 (even if you support yourself entirely) you are considered a ""Dependent"" in the eyes of the government and that income is based on your parent's incomes (as seen on their W-2's and such). 
 If you're over 24 (it may be 24 or older), in a Professional Program (like med school, graduate school, etc.), or if you are married you can then claim your real income (which being in school would be incredibly low) and, in all likelihood, qualify for the best aid (Pell grants, etc.).",Weird ass government financial aid policies.

AskReddit,cguauya,"I was driving down the highway (in the fast lane) at about 90-100 mph. Then, out of nowhere, a (possible literal) million gallons of rain poured down from the skies. I found out that night that somewhere between exits 25 and 30 of this particular interstate, the fast lane becomes a lake. 
 So now I'm half hydroplaning and half driving through the water. Needless to say, I lost almost all control of the vehicle. The front of my Jeep started drifting left (toward the cement divider) so I counter steered to the right. When it started going to the right, I noticed that Optimus Fucking Prime was directly next to me. Kicking up more water onto my wind shield. 
 Now, I'm counter steering both to the left and right to avoid hitting a cement wall that will send me under Optimus as well as avoiding him because (well...) I don't want to be under him.

 My two friends in the car are screaming as I'm trying my best to keep my cool and make sure we get out of this situation alive. I'm letting off the gas and pressing back on it in order to keep hydroplaning to a minimum, but to make sure water doesn't enter my tailpipe.

AskReddit,ck8oza4,"Posted this twice before, but its my best story and defines my life:
Posted this before but here it is again:
Okay, story time.
My father and I had this really cool dream of sailing around the world after I had graduated high school. He grew up sailing, I grew up sailing, so it was pretty much something that was going to happen. We had begun planning the trip for quite some time, and had our course totally mapped out. The one thing we needed, however, was a bigger boat. We had a close friend, Reverend Jim (he wasn't actually a reverend he just called himself that), who had spent his entire life sailing on this beautiful custom hulled boat. He had circumnavigated the world in it and had spent a good portion of his life living on the Mediterranean on it. Anyways, he had always told my father that when he was ready to return to land, the boat would be his. Finally, that day came. Only problem: the boat was in Guatemala and we were in Connecticut.
The plan was to sail the boat in a few short trips: Guatemala to Belize, Belize to Cancun, Mexico. Cancun to Florida, Florida to NYC. The first leg went fine and the boat ended up in Belize. Then, we returned to sail the boat from Belize to Cancun. The first day was interesting. Sailing out of Belize city is a bit of a challenge as there are reefs EVERYWHERE. I mean EVERYWHERE. We were using old sketch charts from the 80s which seemed to be pretty accurate, but it was a long day of me standing on the bow spotting reefs and my dad steering as we navigated through reefs towards the channel.
The first night out on the water was beautiful as there was a lunar eclipse that night. We were relaxing and sailing through the night when we spotted a large tanker a couple hundred yards ahead of us. We radioed them just to make sure they saw us. Turns out they could visibly see us, but we were not showing up on their radar. At this point we realized that both of us would have to be awake for the duration of the trip in order to avoid any calamity with larger vessels.
After the third day of taking very few naps, calamity struck. An unpredicted storm rolled through and caused things to go haywire. We had come up through the straights of Cozumel and the wind was blowing at around 30-40 naughts. Big rolling waves began to settle in, and the boat was starting to get thrown around. Eventually the waves got big enough that as we went down into the trough of the wave, our mast was not receiving any wind at all. We were just sitting ducks. Each wave picked us up and through us closer and closer to a reef that was slightly more inland. Eventually, we were thrown onto the reef and the hull cracked as it was pierced by the reef.
I have no recollection of the next bit and neither does my father. Apparently PTSD set in and we've both forgotten what happened. We spent the next week in Mexico as I worked in a hotel so we would be able to stay there, and he spent that time trying to prepare the damages we had done to the reef and remove the boat from there. We lost the boat and ended up on a crazy bout of plane rides home.
Sorry if the details get hazy towards the end. Like I said, PTSD and time have kinda forced me to forget some of them. Please ask questions if you have any!","Went to sail boat from Belize to Cancun, Storm Set in, Stuck in Mexico"
AskReddit,c3gp85o,"One time, the husband and I were staying in a hotel.  Middle of the night I woke up to use the restroom.  The front door to the hotel room was open about an inch.

It was about the size of a brick and just as square.  I tried a few flushes, this sucker was going no where.

 About 3/4 of the dancers you'll meet are pigs.  Baby wipes everywhere.  Tissues, makeup, glitter, all over the place like the ""accessories"" section of your local porn shop fucking blew up.  In the change room you'll see girls anal flossing with baby wipes, just to make sure there are no willnots hanging off the poop deck.  You'll see them come in wearing sweats and no makeup.  Shocked the everloving hell out of me to see a dancer who I thought was a solid 8 turn out to be about a 4.5 without her warpaint on.  Kinda ruins the experience of going to a strip club after this.  One needs awesome powers of suspension of disbelief to ever walk through the doors of your local ripper shack again. 
 
 I was in the booth one day, just after opening.  A few early birds had come in, and one fella was getting a couch dance.  I didn't see the beginning of this, just the aftermath.  According to the dancer, she was giving her customer a little ass show, as per his request.  Bent over at the waist, she had her hands on the table in front of her.  Customer was enjoying the show, but would put a finger in his mouth and suck it wetly.  She just thought it was weird and kept going.  She flipped her hair over her back, and when she was facing forward, buddy tried to jam his spit-lubed finger up her ass.  I heard the noise she made...it was quite possibly the strangest sound I've ever heard come out of another person.  Half squeal, half scream, and you could tell this wasn't a happy noise.  I heard the doorman on the stairs, I put on another song and ran over.  Doorman had buddy by the belt and the collar and was walking him not-so-gently to the door.  His feet were trying to touch the ground, but it looked like he was miming running.  Unfortunately, the doorman didn't have his hands free to open the door, so he improvised.  I would imagine that the Poop Invader had a goose egg for a while. 
 
 The dancer's change room/locker room was behind the stage, and didn't have a washroom in it.  More than one girl peed in the garbage can...and that sucked balls because chances are, the DJ would be the one to change it.  I walked back there to give a quick roster check to the three girls back there.  This one upstanding young lady was pinching a loaf in the garbage can while the other two were doing their makeup and chatting like this was totally normal.  ""Hey!  Fuck off!"" I said at a loss for words, ""You know I'm going to be the guy who has to change that, right?""  She just giggled and continued pooping.  I spoke to the manager about it, and she told the dancer she would have to change the bag.  The dancer quit on the spot.  Guess who had to change it.  FML. 
 
 Another time, I popped my head back into the change room (you'd think I'd learn), and there's only one girl back there this time.  She was in an odd position, and I'm not sure why I didn't clue in right away, but at this point naked dancers had zero effect on me.  In one fluid motion she removed her hand from her crotch, clutching a lightly reddened tampon.  I left.  See, dancers work 3-7 days a week, 4 weeks a month, and sometimes Aunt Flo comes to visit.  They'll cut the string off the tampon and insert it...fishing it out later.  Some will just stuff the tampon string up there as well...but there have been a few incidents of the cotton pony's tail sticking out of the barn...so most girls just remove the string. 
 
 
 Aside from this, I think it's just seeing behind the curtain that fucks a guy up a little.  Knowing that the girl on stage probably isn't a sex-crazed exhibitionist who wants nothing more than to tease the living hell out of you for a few songs...realizing that some of these girls will be going home alone, or to a deeply dysfunctional relationship...that hurts seeing that shit. 
 All this aside though, most dancers are amazing people.  Women with thick skin who can soldier through the idiotic comments of the morons who sit in gynecology row (shit like ""TAKE IT OFF!!""...well no shit, what do you think she's gonna do? Or the ones who try and convince the dancer to go to a ""party"" with them afterwards.)  There are a few who are all kinds of different flavours of fucked up, but most of them...if you didn't know they were dancers, you couldn't pick them out on the street.  Well...other than the fact that most off-duty dancers will be wearing loose-fitting clothes, hair tied back in a ponytail, and very little makeup.","Strip clubs are messed up places sometimes, dancers are people too."
AskReddit,ca4rfy2,"Just one. But it is long, complicated and not happy. 
 A guy friend of mine, Sean(name change) started dating one of my girl friends, Sarah (name changed).  I was very happy for them and they dated for like 2 or 3 years. 
 I held a very high opinion of Sean because he helped me though a really shitty experience at a party a few years ago. I was molested/raped/somethinged when I was passed out at a friends house and I didn't know who it was. I won't get into details.  Anyway He was very understanding and comforting and after that I always spoke well of him. It wasn't hard, everyone loved him. He was very attractive, fun, outgoing and extremely polite and nice. 
 Fast forward to last summer. I get a phone call from Sarah inquiring about Sean and his relationship with my roommate. I didn't have anything to contribute except that they seemed to frequently exchange friendly texts. Apparently this opened up a can of worms. Turns out Sean has been cheating on Sarah, who is super hot and cool and chill, the WHOLE time they've been dating. He was always super accusational towards her about talking to guys and really vague about his own communication and she never noticed because she never cared or thought to be suspicious because she is chill as fuck. Anywho, Sarah is now becoming hysterical, and I can't quite figure out why. I mean yeah he cheated on her and that's super shitty but no need for stage 4 melt down or anything. She then drops the nuclear sized bomb on me that he is the biggest piece of shit on the planet and he hits her. She confessed that STRANGERS have had to step in multiple times so she could run to get away. He did it in public, usually at night but like still, be a bigger piece of shit. She talked about his drinking problem and how he is always so sorry the next day that she forgives him. And if she doesn't right away he threatens to ruin her life and that no one will believe her if she tells. That she is the slutty one and everyone will believe him, not her. Mind you this girl is about 5 foot 6 and weights MAYBE 100lbs. she is some crazy vegan and exercises like crazy and is just one of those rail thin people. And she is super intelligent. Sarah starts talking about how she is so scared no one will believe her if she tells and that everyone will hate her for breaking up with him. And how scared of him she is. Sean is a college football player and they appear to be the all-american couple. I have never understood exactly why abused women stay in the relationships but seeing it first had was fucking freaky and I wouldn't wish that kind of psychological torture on anyone. 
 Back to the pathological liar part, Sarah attempts to leave Sean. He then starts talking shit to her about me. She called me fuming mad at me and confronted me about what he said. He had the audacity to tell her that back in the day, when we were at that party that he helped me out at, that I was having sex with some dude thinking it was Sean and got really upset when it wasn't him. So basically he told her I thought I was fucking him, when they were dating, but I wasn't and that I was acutally having sex with some guy I didn't know. And I'm a huge slut and she shouldn't believe anything I say. Mind you, I haven't actually told her anything, I have only listened to her and encouraged her to get the fuck away from him. He HAS to know that she is going to ask me about this and that I will undoubtedly tell her what really happened. He never changed his story after he told her. He was SO sure it was true he was getting mad she didn't believe him. No Logic. Shit really hit the fan then. He started harassing her and telling her ""he saw her out with all the guys last night being a slut"" when she never went out. He would call her a liar and tell her not to fuck with him that he remembered talking to her at the bar, etc. He was literally coming up with just bat shit crazy shit. He was in denial that she left him. Still would call her baby and go over to her family's house and shit. This (and much, much more) went on for weeks.  Basically until he moved away for law school. She hasn't really told anyone yet except her close friends and family (I think) because she says she is embarrassed. I told her she should tell the whole entire fucking world. 
 I was at a bar a few months ago with some of our mutual friends, who all still think the fucking world of him and he when he saw me he went in for a fucking hug. I shoved him back and told him to fuck off. Everyone just stared at me and then casually went back to drinking. It's strange because even though I know a lot of terrible things about him and I know what he can do and how crazy he is, after being near him for an evening, I almost found myself thinking that Sarah was the crazy one, and that he CAN'T possibly be abusive, or have made of those lies up. I mean, I've seen the bruises with my own eyes. I literally went to the bathroom and splashed water on my face and GTFO of there. He is scary because he is the LAST person you would ever ever ever expect to be like this. I never would have believed it if I hadn't seen it first hand. I mean I almost didn't and I did see it first hand. He is charming and kind. He volunteers in the community and everyone knows who he is and loves him. And he is a fucking psychopath.

 but anyways, as I pass her I thought about glancing at her and trying to make eye contact, but then I realized that the act of doing that would probably make me look really creepy (I have a beard)

I was still snorting lines and nodding off to Adult Swim in my room, (I was perhaps the most boring heroin addict ever,) while he began shooting up, disappearing for days, getting arrested.

 I'm really sorry that you had to put up with that. No one deserves someone doing that, and you have every right to be pissed as all fuck. I'd be, if I were in you position. With your boyfriend, though... I'm just as sorry that he's telling you 'it's apparently her sense of humour' because seriously, even if you might find something funny,  that does not justify you being a dick at people about it . 
 I can kind of see why he does, though. The short version is basically that it's entirely like she does this to him. And to her husband. Or to anyone she's around, generally. If his mom is anything like my mom then she's probably a really sweet person... most of the time, then absolutely terrible the rest of it and you just keep feeling that you can't really hold it against her because 'that's just how she is' and 'she did so much for you' and 'it's not like you DIDN'T cry or fail or anything, right? stop being so sensitive-' 
 Growing up in that kind of household with that kind of person isn't easy. You end up justifying everything they do because the alternative is to kind of admit that your parent who hugs you and tells you they love you and then at the very next moment bullies and insults you is not a good person. It's not easy for anyone to think that. A lot of people never realise and just figure it's their fault for not being able to 'get' the other person's humour. In my case I thought for ages that I was being too serious or too judgemental until I actually started talking with people about it. Turned out my mom was a dick. That wasn't fun.","Your boyfriend's mother is a real nasty piece of work, your boyfriend might not even realise, I'm honestly sorry that anyone has to deal with someone like that or live with her, and I sincerely hope it works out for the both of you.

AskReddit,c3rp8cg,"There are a lot of different opinions out there, and unfortunately, the best I can say is to do what feels right for you. Talk to a doctor you trust, even if it takes a little while to find one. While antidepressants can have serious side effects, you might want to try a couple of different brands, and stop in a medically safe way if they don't seem to do anything after a couple months or if they make you sick. 
 I've got depression and anxiety, and I've never had a good experience with medication. I've had some make me sick, some give me allergic reactions, and none help at all. That said, I rarely respond to any medication, even NyQuil or Tylenol. I've tried most antidepressants out there and had no luck. I know they work for a lot of people, though.

I came home from elementary school and was waiting for my mom like I usually do to come from work and unlock the house and make me dinner.

We figure out that they only stole 2 bucks. That's it. We obviously called the cops, they took finger prints and after they left (they later called and it turned out to be a couple Mexicans who worked at the neighbourhood nearby, constructing it) my mom let me come to work with her instead of staying at the house, because at the time I'm pretty sure I mentally and almost physically shit myself.

AskReddit,cgu8a15,"You have chosen to play in sandbox mode.  The key to enjoying a game of this nature is to set your own goals.  Sandbox mode encourages creative play, as free expression is essentially unlimited as the only real goal becomes internal, to overcome boredom.   Many people find it useful to live extensively in the moment and maximize the experience by increasing your immersion level. 
 When playing in sandbox mode, it is important to realize that the experience is the goal in itself, and therefore maximizing the experience is the key. 
 One interesting feature in sandbox mode is that the game can end at any time.  This creates an interesting paradox as it is inherently unknowable from within the game itself as to whether the game has meaning beyond what the player ascribes to it.   This uncertainty factor can be overwhelming at first, but it also serves as a motivation to play well and maximize the experience. 
 The problem you are experiencing is primarily an issue of scale, due to comprehending just how vast the sandbox is, and recognizing that it is unlikely that you will be able to fully explore to the full extent within the limited time frame that the game usually runs for. 
 Your perspective of scale has caused you to experience a form of vertigo, which is making you forget that you came here to play.   If you hadn't come here to play, you wouldn't be here, however you are here, and are therefore immersed.   The trick is to dial up your immersion level. 
 The ultimate construct is an internal battle of self to determine whether you have meaning, this is the battle of ego and is well documented in psychadelic literature. 
 What can be verified is that you are here, that you are striving to accept the parameters of the setting you find yourself in, and that you have determined that your impact is unimportant to the game's outcome.   This detachment is affecting your ability to immerse in the experience fully. 
 What can be determined is that your self exists and processes stimulus from the environment.  It is unknowable whether that stimulus is internally or externally generated.   This creates an interesting dynamic as those boundaries can be made somewhat indeterminate.  As you dwell on this internal struggle you will realize that the value of the game is in playing it, as it doesn't matter whether you are generating every experience or whether it is being generated for you. 
 This leads to a phase of exploration.  At the basest level it is important to realize that the fact that you are experiencing is the key dynamic, the background, the setting, the roles that surround you are all mechanisms designed to enhance your experience. 
 As a participant in the experience, your only real option is to test the boundaries of your experience.  Your subscription to Nihilism is ironically an embracing of the ego's need to 'feel important' at the expense of the quality of your experience. 
 This is much as if an actor aspires to fame as a driving force, rather than fully immersing themselves in the role and character they are playing.  This sought fame is of limited value compared to the enjoyment that can be derived from experiencing the role to the fullest.  When the actor is able to forget they are on the set and commit fully to the moment then they are maximizing the experience. 
 Ultimately it comes down to this, you are here and while you are here, the one thing that is evident is that you are part of the dynamic.  The dynamic clearly exists, ultimately it doesn't matter whether you are in the spotlight or invisible, as vanity is self-created. 
 What does matter is that you are playing the game, participating, experiencing and it really doesn't matter how or why the engine works, it is enough to know that it does and that you are bound to your experience, the rest of it is distraction. 
 Test your boundaries, it may be you vs. the incomprehensibly vast universe, it may be you against yourself, the show may end when the curtains come down, it may not.  One thing that is known is that it is a creative opportunity.  It is not really important whether you are in control of the universe, at its mercy, or are a meaningless artifact of randomness.  What is important is that you are here now and that immersion and experience has inherent value, that simply being in an exploratory space has value.   Don't make things more complicated than they are, simply play, enjoy, do, be.  Goals are abstractions, reasons are abstractions, immersion is everything.   Be creative for the sake of being creative, simply because you can.  Its a lot like taking a vacation :)","Stop asking why, and ask why not.  You have the ticket, you are on the ride, enjoy the experience while it lasts"
AskReddit,c5g5752,"OK, so I might be braking the rules by reversing roles, who knows. I was the service provider. I work at a local retail clothing store called Peebles. It was a pretty slow day so far and nothing much was going on. I was helping cash out customers and straighten racks around my register mostly with a cheery attitude because I like my job, strange huh? 
 I get this customer that walks up to my register and I greet her and ask if there's anything I can help her with. She's got a return and says she hopes I can help her. I told her that I'm willing to try my best and help her. She places a bag on the counter with a pair of shorts in it. Apparently the metal button clasp in the front broke which is very reasonable for a return.  I forgot what the bag was but it wasn't a Peebles bag. It's fine though we get a lot of customers that forget the bag but this purchase I could tell was from at least a month ago. No big deal. 
 Ask for a receipt and she didn't have one. OK, next thing is to try and look up the receipt in the system by the barcode number and a card number. No barcode ticket on it. Alright limited options now. But it's fine cause our policy says that if the customer is exchanging for the exact same item and could be any size, we don't need a receipt as long as there's a reasonable cause. Problem though, we don't carry that style of shorts anymore. Can't even find them on the racks. Alright. Next step, try to find a way to look up barcodes in the system using an item's VPN number, usually located somewhere on the tag. This is a learning experience for me and I'm getting a line of people now at my register. Find out how to do it on another pair of shorts successfully, go to search for the number on the other pair, error comes up saying we don't even sell it anymore so we can't even give her a price on it. She starts arguing with me about how any other store just gives them whatever it is on sale or however the lowest it's been on sale was. Well for her sake I didn't want her to lose money, and for mine I couldn't even find the prices of it if I wanted to. 
 This lady is getting upset saying things like, ""Are you freakin kidding me?"", ""Is this going to take long?!"". All with an intimidating attitude. I'm not one to get angry but I like helping people and don't enjoy seeing people get upset. I tell her I'm going to go back to my manager who's on a conference call and CANNOT move from the phone since she's talking to the district manager and other bosses of hers. I go back there away from my line of people and ask for some help from her, after her explaining again that she can't move from the office I tell her I understand and just need her to try and find some sort of receipt or pricing that I can give her for the shorts. (It's a known brand in the store and no doubt we've sold them there before but we might still be able to give her some sort of credit.) 
 I go back to my crowd of customers and tell the lady that my manager is back there basically multitasking her ass off trying to help me and there's no other employees in the store besides us two since the other manager who was working out front is now on lunch and had no clue this would happen. So she reluctantly starts looking around the store while I assure her that my manager will call me back when she's found something or nothing. 
 I continue to help other customers as fast as I can so I can get this line down. After probably 10 minutes and my line finally empty the lady comes up and asks if she's finished yet as it's so easy to look for literally thousands of receipts for 1 sale on 1 pair of shorts most likely 3-6 months ago. I tell her I'll go get a status update and see what I can find out for her. My manager tells me that she couldn't find the receipt and couldn't find the old price on the shorts but to give her the price for  insert random same brand look-a-like shorts here  and tells me that they're coming up as $17.00. 
 I return to my register with more customers eagerly greeting me. I ask the first customer to please wait while I tell the other lady the news and the customer smiles and says OK. But before the customer could even finish her small retort the lady with the shorts claims with much assertiveness, ""Yeah, because I was here first!"" I just blink and give an apologetic smile to the customer for the others behavior. 
 I go ahead and start with the return and enter in the new code for the shorts we have and am stunned when I realize they didn't come up as $17 like I thought but about 6 and some change. If a return is made without a receipt there is a much lower price that we cannot go above giving them. I was under the impression that the 17 was that price but in reality that's what they were being sold for in the store for. I assumed I was having a register error and quickly overrode the price to jack it up to 17 and her new shorts she was getting was priced at 16. Through the whole phase of panicky me trying to get everything right and helping to the best of my ability for everyone's sake she's spewing off sentences like, ""This is so ridiculous."" ""Are you serious....?"" I gave her the dollar and exchanged the shorts and tried as hard as I could to muster enough strength to smile and say ""Have a nice day..."" 
 Got scolded for jacking up the price of the pants and later on my manager was even more pissed off that she had to stay in the back room when the conference call wasn't even that important and she would've been more help to me out on the sales floor. 
 Fast forward maybe a week and a half later I overhear another customer chit chatting about the scenario to a fellow coworker and I recognized it and chimed in explaining that it was I who was helping her. The customer was baffled at how calm I remained and how inconsiderate the lady was especially since she had her daughter aged prob anywhere from 6-10 with her while she was arguing with me (Forgot to mention that.) What I didn't know was that this customer that witnessed it also saw the lady start getting into it with another customer while I was away talking to my manager about the situation. Apparently the lady thought she heard another customer in line whispering to her husband about her and the lady just dug into her. It was at that point where the current customer just left before things got ugly.","Customer tried to return broken apparel without receipt, got pissed when couldn't find it in system and went through extensive searching to find it for her."

 In my house, it's relatively small, I hear footsteps coming from upstairs. Naturally, I check, and I can hear voices coming from my brothers room. I go in, check every possible place, nothing.

We went in and turned on the light, and these shadow-like figures disappeared before us. As they do this, my dog starts barking like he never has before. We run downstairs as he's barking out the window, so we let him out and he chases something to the back of the garden then growls for a good ten minutes.

AskReddit,c9irajp,"Well, I'm sure I've done more regrettable things, but this is what comes to mind: 
 I was making a pan of homemade tiramisu, which is a delicious, faux-Italian dessert made of layers of espresso- and booze-soaked ladyfinger cookies, and sweetened, booze/espresso-flavored mascarpone, topped with powdered chocolate. 
 First of all, the entire recipe is a messy nightmare of wet, sticky cookies and glop everywhere. Do not make tiramisu at home, that's all I can say about that.  So I was already on a losing streak by the time I came up with this bright idea. 
 I'd finally gotten my tiramisu layered and assembled after much mess and frustration. The last step was to dust the top of the entire dessert with a thin coat of cocoa. Only problem: no sifter. Well, I'll just try and sprinkle it on by hand, I thought. No dice: instead of an even layer, I had one dense, thick area of cocoa powder and the rest of the tiramisu was still uncoated. 
 Well, I thought, (and here's the point when the magic happened) there's one way to remedy this situation: I'LL JUST BLOW ON IT. 
 I blew. I was successful beyond my wildest dreams. Cocoa powder was evenly distributed perfectly over my entire tiramisu. And my entire face, so I looked like I was in blackface.

AskReddit,c5g7v9s,"I've been on the other side of this type of thing.  Last summer I worked at this little seasonal seafood place (It's not even near the ocean, it's on a shitty little lake in Mass.)  It was a pretty small restaurant, and family owned. The head chef was also one of the owners, and working there I got the sense that I had just set foot on a rapidly sinking ship.  Apparently the restaurant had been started by the current owners' parents, and until recently (the summer before I started working there actually) the mother had still been running the show with her daughter working for her.  The daughter was abso-fucking-lutely nuts.  She would get to the restaurant around 10am every day to start to open the place.  She also began drinking at this time.  Needless to say, by the time 5:00 rolled around and the dinner crowd started to hit, she was plastered.  She would do this thing where she would fuck something up, slowly realize it, and then find someone else to scream at for it.  Unless it was clearly her fault, then she'd just scream at you for something random.  I mean she would literally look around for something to scream at you about.  And when I say she would scream at you, I mean she would  SCREAM  at you, often really personal or just degrading shit, not meant to make anyone work better or harder, but just to straight up insult them.

AskReddit,c7l3yyl,"Yep. First off, I'm female. About 8 years ago, when I was 12, I used to go to a church youth group (it was one of those ""my parents made me"" things). There was a guy there who was pretty nice, whom I'd talk to occasionally just to be nice. Then I stopped to church. 
 Fast forward 6 years. I went to church again once for a church event celebrating anniversaries of various church-goer couples, including my parents for their 20th anniversary. I see this guy there. We chat a bit just to be nice, then I reluctantly exchange phone numbers with him just to catch up. 
 Now I had been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half at this point, when stalker guy confesses his love to me (""I've been in love with you for the past 6 years"", ""You are my only friend who actually talks to me""). Oh dear. I was just talking to him to be nice. Just through texting, he had learned where I live, where I work, etc. 
 Then he starts randomly showing up at my house uninvited and unannounced. Once on my birthday when I was just having a little homemade dinner party with my boyfriend and my two room mates, to give me a present (a painting of my pet bird he had painted himself). 
 Once he showed up randomly at my work. Apparently he had come in twice before to look for me, but I wasn't working those days. So he just decided to keep coming into my work until I was there. 
 I've told him many times that I had no intention of dating him or anything, and I eventually got engaged to my boyfriend (about a year later), after which he  still  didn't get the point. I didn't want to be too harsh with this guy because he has some major depression problems and didn't want to harm him in any way. Eventually it just got way too much for me and I firmly ended all contact with him. I'm not sure is he was okay after that.","Acquaintance I reconnected with randomly showed up at my house and my work uninvited and unannounced, and I couldn't shake him off because I was afraid he might kill himself."

AskReddit,c4vpyp0,"I was at a big party at a good friends house, and one of his local friends (who I didn't know) was there with his brother who was visiting.  These kids were being really rude; they were real drunk and hitting on two of my female friends in a very inappropriate way. 
 My female friends were pretty upset and seemed a bit scared of these two guys, so I started telling them they should leave in what I thought was a reasonable way (I was pretty firm about it, but wasn't trying to piss them off). 
 Needless to say it pissed them off, and they were getting all, ""don't talk to my fucking brother like that!"" and up in my face.  I kept telling them to leave cause they were being dicks and no one wanted them there; at this point I figured things were gonna get out of hand so I started being pretty forceful with my language. 
 Pretty soon one of the brothers started pushing me while in my face (like when someone is trying to start a fight), so I shoved him into a table, and his brother took a swing at me (hit me in the side of the neck but it was a pretty soft hit).  By this time, most other guys in the room were on my side of the argument, so as soon as he took the swing, shit got a little crazy and eventually the host (my friend, and the friend of one of the brothers) got the kid in one of those fancy MMA headlocks and choked him for a bit until he stopped flipping out. 
 We eventually herded them out of the party after a threat of calling the cops. 
 Anyway, it was pretty awkward because I started a fight at my friend's house with one of his friends (although it was totally justified).

AskReddit,c8q1iqi,"ohhh too bad I´m late to the party, but still, here goes: 
 the absolute worst date I´ve been on was with a guy I had been seeing for a few months at that point and we´d had a conversation very recently about how he really liked me and wanted to continue seeing me, but didn´t think it would turn out as a relationship or something...so I kind of let the whole thing cool down a little, especially when he went to his hometown about three hours away for the summer. 
 He asked me if wanted to come visit him there for a day and I, being a little bored and maybe because I actually liked that guy, agreed and drove there. 
 We´d agreed to meet there and he would show me his hometowm, we´d have a nice lunch and I´d be going back in the evening....or so I thought. 
 Little did I know, he´d arranged a secret ""meet-the-parents"".
I still have no idea why, I´m guessing he hadn´t brought home someone in quite some time and his parents were starting to ask a lot of questions so maybe he just took his chance....? 
 So the moment he opened the door, his mother turned up behind him, smiling broadly and telling me, how wonderful it was to meet me.
At first, I was like ""ok, she´s probably just being nice to all of his friends"".
After all, what could he have possibly told her ""hey Mom, there´s this girl I had random sex and few dates with coming over today, great, huh?""
Well, she had baked not one, but three cakes ""for the occasion"" and had us sit down for coffee...and then the interrogation started....about me,my family, my studies and always little nudge-nude-wink-wink-questions how I was getting along with her son being out of town for sooooooo long....how we met an so on.
At this point I was starting to get a  little  uncomfortable, because she clearly thought we were an item and I kept looking at him with growing desperation but he made no attempt to tell her we weren´t together and I didn´t want to just blow his cover, so I thought, let´s get this over with, be nice to her and we´ll be out of the house in a few minutes and tonight I´ll be back in my city, no problem..... 
 well....let´s just say, she had other plans.
Him and I finally went out to get some ice-cream and walk around and just had a pleasant afternoon (no mention of the whole thing, so I let it slide) until I told him I had to get back to my car and get going, else I´d be home very late in the night. 
 He looked at me  really surprised  and said ""but...my Mom has been preparing dinner for us all day...she has been looking forward to having you over for dinner, she´s been in the kitchen for at least four hours!"" ...and before I could even really get a grasp on what was going on, we were back at his house, and eating dinner...the interrogation continues....
and then his Mom started to pour me some wine. I told her thank you, but no thank you, because I had a three hour drive ahead of me and thank you very much for the delicious dinner,but I really had to get going. 
 ha-HA...no, she said, she  insists  on having me stay the night, there´s no way she would have me drive three hours this late in the day and she has my friend´s brother´s room prepared for me. 
Dear God was I creeped out, my cheeks were starting to hurt from being polite and smiling all day and I just....couldn´t turn her down, she was staring at me so expectantly and gushing about how happy she´d be to have me over and she insists... 
 did I mention she called me the wrong name for the  whole  day, always profusely apologizing for it by ""I swear, my son NEVER had a girlfriend with that name!"" 
 so him and I went upstairs to his room later....(the hallways were plastered with photos of him and some girl, which I could only assume was his ex-girlfriend, since he doesn´t have  a sister).
Things got a little better, we made out for some time and then....
....he went downstairs to ask his Mom whether or not I could stay in his room...in a whiny voice....the guy´s 27. She said no. 
 At that point I was really ready to climb out of the window on the third floor, just to get out, but I didn´t want to be rude, so I stayed put. 
 I had to have breakfast with her the next morning (he was out working, I´d already said bye, he would avoid any question as to why all this), she wanted to know everything about me and then kept delaying my leave, telling me traffic was soooo bad this morning. 
She hugged me very very tightly when I left and told me she really thought I was great and I could come back any time. 
 Boy, was I glad to be out of that house, it was the most uncomfortable situation I´ve ever been in, pretending to be a guy´s girlfriend to his mother, without being asked and with being told beforehand, that we would probably never be anything serious... 
yeah I didn´t see much chances for him and me either after that day.

AskReddit,cg65mzt,"Not sure if this qualifies as crazy, but here's the story. 
 My old house was pretty open planned - you could almost see the whole way through - and the home computer was in a little alcove right before the kitchen. My little brother (who at the time was 12) was/is an avid gamer, and whenever our parents would go out, he'd jump on the computer with his headphones on and the volume turned up pretty loud. 
 I was with a girl who lived a 6 hour drive away, so we didn't see each other a lot. Anyway, we were on the couch and my parents were out, so we were fooling around with each other while - of course- my brother was on the computer. One thing led to another and before i knew it, i was holding her off the ground against the living room wall going at it like nothing else. We were into being slightly violent towards each other (me more to her than anything) so when i got tired of holding her against the wall i laid her down on the dining table and continued, slapping her face occasionally. We finished and cleaned up, went back to the couch and finished the movie. 
 My brother was about 5 meters away the whole time and had only needed to get up and take two step backwards to see what was going on.","had sex while my brother was 5 meters away, without a door separating us."
AskReddit,c5mh6d0,"The English language. 
 Yeah, I'm that guy. The one on the internet who corrects your grammar (no, I don't use it as my sole argument, I just toss it in character evidence). Speaking as someone who failed a year of English in highschool, I find it absolutely disgusting that people can still screw up their own language. 
 Perhaps it's resentment from my father who suggested that all the foreigners who come here should learn English. Perhaps it's because every relationship I've been in had people who would correct my grammar. My rule eventually became: ""You can't touch my grammar until I touch your tits"", but it didn't matter because by then I was pretty much flawless from the constant correction. Taking a foreign language didn't help. I understand it all even better now. And you know what?  It's not that difficult! 
 I know that I'm inviting dozens to come by, take a casual glance and point out the errors I've made in this post. I shouldn't throw stones when we're all prone to human error, correct? Well fuck that, because I know I'm going to get corrected anyway and at least I make an effort. I've spent countless hours trying to explain to my own true-blue-American parents on the difference between an adjective and adverb (who can guess which ones?). I can understand not knowing, but to not be able to grasp and correct simple issues is just disgusting. 
 For awhile, I was bad about my who's and whom's. There was a time when I didn't watch my prepositions. But, to speak rhetorically, do you know what? I changed. I changed the way I spoke because we have a beautiful language. Don't give me that Latin/Italian/French/Spanish (No one ever says Romanian) crap, because not one of them can hold a candle to the vocabulary of Her Majesty's empire. When you spread your culture across the world, who's surprised to hear that we have the most varied language and the most dialects? 
 There's hypocrisy in my position. I know that new dialects form as a result of the speaker's laziness. But we used to have great playwrights creating new words to share. Now we have Yolo. And McJob. And every single person who says ""lol"" is a word ought to be eliminated from the fucking gene pool (so I suppose I'm saying castration, as opposed to sterilization). And anyone who uses 'u' instead of 'you' under any circumstance -- other than being 10 years of age -- has earned my undying scorn. 
 I don't want to hear that inaccuracies are idiomatic. You don't know what an idiom is and you should feel like a failure. Because you are. The English language is not difficult. It is most certainly not ""the hardest language to learn"", and anyone who perpetuates that myth as fact deserves to have their head bashed in with a horse shoe welded to a giant iron dildo. English is easy. You suck. 
 Don't get me wrong, I find idiomatic language to be beautiful. I think all slang and dialect should take the form of idiomatic language, as the case used to be. Not all this abbreviated expression bullshit and ruined expressions like ""I could care less"". I have the same right to correct some jackass who bastardizes his language like I have the right to tell George Lucas he's ruining the Star Wars films for everyone. A right which I damn-well reserve. 
 The name thrown around for 'my kind' a lot is 'Grammar Nazi', but I find that term inaccurate (and after hearing it enough, I stop thinking it's clever and start getting a bit annoyed that I'm being framed alongside ""genocide incarnate"" for trying to help people not look like twits). This goes along with some of those ""pride in ignorance"" posts in this thread. It's not that I hate people who don't know how to speak our language properly. It's merely that I hate you for feeling like you're better than me because you're shit at the only language you may ever speak. So I don't go around correcting people the first time they make a mistake; I correct them the first time they willfully make a mistake. 
 And when I hear someone wanting to ""find them mexircans who dun speak our language"" and ""kick em out"", you better believe I'm on a warpath. I yelled at my own grandfather, with whom I had fantastic relations, and probably ruined any hope of him dying without feeling insulted by my very presence.

I started to notice pain and immediately realized what I had done so I ran to the shower and washed it all off. I was pretty red and one part of my chest had a chemical burn that got little blisters on it. My urethra however was a different story. It looked fine but it wasn't. The water alone made me scream in pain but I just went through with it and washed everything out as best I could.

I couldn't even let my dick touch the side of my underwear because it hurt like a motherfucker. Every time I pissed there was a slight reddish hue from the blood.

AskReddit,c8o8h7u,"First off, are you certain this $500 apartment allows two dogs?  If it says generically ""Pets allowed"", that usually means cats or lower. 
 Secondly, you'll have a really tough time getting a landlord to approve you for a $400-$500 apartment with an $800 monthly income.  If you were to somehow get approved for a $500 per month apartment, you'll have to come up with first and last month's rent, plus a security deposit that is usually equivalent to an additional month.  So that's more than all of your savings gone before you even walk in the door.  Don't forget about utilities which may or may not be included in your rent.  Electricity, gas, water, and sewer are the ones you don't have much choice about, and then there's phone, cable, and internet.  The rule of thumb I've always heard is that your lodging should be at most about 35% of your monthly, which for you would be about $300.  Are there any apartments you've found in that price range that take dogs? 
 After rent and utilities, you still have to buy household stuff like toilet paper, cleansers, soaps, toothpaste, etc.  Does the apartment have laundry facilities, an on-site laundry room, or will you be using a laundromat?  Keep in mind that pay laundry adds up fast, and is  time consuming . 
 And then there's food for you and the dogs.  Again, this can be pricey, depending on how picky of an eater you are.  Couponing may be your friend.  I'd recommend checking out afullcup.com to try to save some money when you can. 
 How do you get to your job?  Be sure to budget for gas money or public transportation costs too. 
 Lastly, be sure to save some money back to cover incidentals like new clothing, car repairs, vet bills, etc.",It sounds kind of tight on your current wage.  Perhaps negotiating with your dad is a better way to go.  Offer him $x per month to keep the dogs until you're in a better position to move out and take them with you.

 As for spaghetti at an American restaurant... apart from a few regional cuisines (Southern generally, which has a couple of subvariants; barbecue; Tex-mex), there isn't really much of an American cuisine  per se ; it's mostly adaptations from other cuisines. And the way Americans eat spaghetti bears little to no resemblance to how Italians do. So that is not a strange thing to see.

AskReddit,chxzi8u,"I have been a step father for a teenage girl for a little over two years. Her real father is a scumbag POS that just up and vanished when he found out he knocked up my wife (obviously way before I married, let alone met her).  He's never seen his daughter, and never paid a dime in child support. He left my wife to raise her daughter on her own.  Thankfully her parents loved her daughter like one of their own children, so they helped raising her. 
 I've known my step daughter since she was 9 (she just turned 16).  She's a wonderful kid. Does very well in school, is into video games and anime...and the best part is she loves me unconditionally. To her, I'm her real father. And that's just a wonderful feeling. She always brags to her friend how she has such a ""cool dad"" who likes to draw, play StarCraft, and listens to German power metal.  I even got her in to Metallica and Helloween (her favorite song is Keeper of the Seven Keys). 
 I also have a daughter on the way. My wife is 8 months pregnant. We've already named her after Gwen Stacy from the Spider-Man comics.  I've decreed that boys are evil scumbags, and she's not allowed to have sex until she's 40.  The only exception is if she's a lesbian. That way she can be the dominant one, get artificially inseminated, and have a kid, thus carrying on the family name, since I have no sons.

 That all being said, I haven't noticed any change in my perception of women. In fact, I think I've changed my perception of men in that none of them can be trusted, and they're all sex hounds.

AskReddit,ce5sfxw,"This happened sixteen or seventeen years ago. I had a dog and a cat. The dog was named Puck, and he was the best dog I've ever had. I got him from the pound and he was a peculiar mix of what looked to be golden retriever and... I dunno, corgi? He was blond and had features like a golden, but long and low-slung like corgis or basset hounds. He had green-yellow eyes and a light brown nose and he was the smartest dog I've ever had, too, and very personable and good. 
 The cat was named Tempest. We called her Temmy. Puck had found her while my then-boyfriend was taking Puck for a walk. She was a kitten, hidden under a bush, her hip dislocated and her tail broken. I'm not a cat person, but I was glad my BF brought her home nonetheless, and she was a pretty good cat. Very sweet and also personable. Almost doglike, which is why I think I liked her more than I generally like cats. 
 Anyway, one night we'd gone out to dinner, and while we were gone, we left Temmy and Puck out with free run of the apartment. Temmy jumped up on the kitchen counter while we were gone and knocked down a bag of chips. Puck nosed into the bag of chips to get at them, and got the bag stuck on his head. When we returned from dinner, Puck was lying in the middle of the living room floor, shit (literal shit) everywhere, and the bag was still on his head. He wasn't breathing. When we took the bag off, his nose was paler than usual and his eyes were rolled back into his head. We didn't know how long he'd been out - not too long because he was still warm, just not breathing. My BF called the 24-hour vet while I, um, gave my dog CPR. At the time, the mouth-to-mouth thing was still part of CPR, so as well as chest compressions, I gave Puck mouth-to-mouth. 
 And it worked! He started breathing again! He was extremely disoriented and wobbly when he came to. We carried him out to the car and took him to the vet. I was fully expecting there to be some brain damage. It's rather anticlimactic, but he was fine. No brain damage, full recovery, and he seemed just as smart as before the incident, possibly even smarter, since never again did he get a snack bag stuck on his head. (We were extra-vigilant after that about not leaving stuff like that on the counters for Temmy to knock off again.)","Cat knocked chip bag off the counter, dog stuck head in chip bag and smothered himself, found him just in the knick of time and performed CPR (including mouth-to-mouth).

AskReddit,c2tjew9,"Growing up I had a yellow lab who was always tearing the house to shreds when we weren't home.  After it happened a few times, we put a gate up between the living room and the kitchen and would leave her in the kitchen when we were out. We quickly found out that this was futile as we would return home and the living room would be torn apart, and the dog would be in the kitchen, wagging her tail pretending like she had no idea what happened in the living room (you could see in her reaction that she was thinking we had no idea it was her, after all, she was gated in the kitchen the whole time, right?).  
 After cleaning up the mess, my dad explains his new plan to prevent such issues.  The next day, we went out and bought a second gate.  His plan was simple, she may be able to jump over one gate, but there is no way in hell she could jump over two gates stacked one on top of another. At this point I should also mention that these were very expensive heavy duty gates, and once they were in place, it would take an incredible amount of force to knock them down without undoing the locking mechanisms.  
  The next day, we were going on a day trip.  Before leaving my dad put his plan in motion and set the gates up one on top of another.  They were tall gates, and this left about a one foot clearance at the top of the door frame.  We left for the day, and when we came back, the living room was destroyed and the dog was sitting in the kitchen wagging her tail.  The gates were still in placed and showed no signs that they were tampered with.  We were completely baffled.  This happened two more times until my dad decided to go out and buy a video camera to figure out exactly what was going on.  
 We picked a Sunday morning to go out to breakfast and walk around Newburyport (a small town on the ocean in Massachusetts).  When we returned home, sure enough, the living room was a mess and the dog was in the kitchen with her typical smug grin.  We immediately reviewed the tape and found out that our yellow lab was a genius.  The tape showed her walking over to the gate, where she proceeded to stand on her hind legs and dig her paws into the grate on the gate.  She then did the same with her hind legs, one at a time, until she was holding herself up on the gate.  She climbed all the way to the top, squeezed through the 1 foot gap at the top of the door frame and jumped safely to the ground in the living room.  After about an hour of video in which all we could see is the occasional decorative pillow being thrown near the doorway, we see the dog approach the gate, climb back over, and sit down in the kitchen.  Not 5 minutes later we returned home. (I don't know how she knew we were going to be home at that very moment, but she somehow did.)",My yellow lab figured out how to climb an impenetrable gate fortress like a mountain goat and accurately predict when we would be home so she wouldn't get caught destroying our living room.

So, I wasn't thinking there was any reason not to pick the lock, grab what I needed out of their room and run out.  Walking in on my parents mid doggy style (with them both facing me) turns out to be a really good reason to not do that.

AskReddit,ceu0l68,"I have two stories! 
 1) I met a guy at a bar and he said he was 24.  I took him home because, in my drunk state, it was totally innocent of him to want to stay on my couch because he lived further from the bar than I did.  Anyway, we started making out and he took off his pants.  His license fell out of his pocket and I picked it up to look at his picture.  Turns out... he was born in 1982.  So he was 30 at the time.  I was 21.  He lost major points for lying.  I was creeped out but also stupidly let him stay at my place that night anyway. 
 I was trying to sleep but he kept asking me if I was okay when I was clearly asleep. So I kept waking up for that.  He also used the bathroom four times, which woke me up each time.  And he talked in his sleep, in the rare instances that he was actually asleep.  When he wasn't talking in his sleep, he snored. 
 Nothing creepy happened, but in hindsight it was still a really poor choice to let him stay the night.  Sketchy as fuck, and I barely slept a wink. 
 2) This guy was 31 and I knew he was 31 from the beginning.  So he had that going for him.  I was also 21 at the time.  He was a friend of a friend, and hung around my group of friends.  He had a reputation for hitting on girls much younger than himself.  I always found him kind of weird, but was flattered by the attention.  One drunk evening, I found myself inviting him in.  One thing led to another, and I discovered he had a small and mostly limp dick.  He said that it just happens when guys get older.  I actually ended up hooking up with him once more and he was sober but still had the same issues.  So I think he had ED. (At least, I hope he was an abnormality and not all guys are like this in their early 30s!)",Hooked up with two guys who were ~10 yrs older than me.  Both situations were disappointing at best.
AskReddit,cim0kn5,"I still feel bad about this. 
 There was this one kid in my neighbor hood. Let say his name is Timmy. Timmy was a bully. He was 2 years older than me and 5 years older than my brother. He would would beat up both me and my brother. But we would put up with him. Then one week he took it to another level. Me , my brother and our other friend were in the park. We were playing with our Pokemon cards when Timmy and his friend come and takes our cards and starts ripping them apart. We try to fight them, but they were just stronger. I was enraged. My little brother started crying. They were laughing while this 7 yr-old (my little brother) is sobbing. This made my blood boil. Later we went to tell on him to his Mom, but she wouldn't believe us. I still hate her to this day . I guess it was hard for her, being a single mom and all. She was like"" That's not how I raised Timmy, he is a good boy"". Like we were rotten kids for telling on him. So later that night, at dinner I told my parents about it. My Dad told me , his mom was crazy. He had gone to her before , and try to talk to her about Timmy's behavior , but she wouldn't believe him or any other parent, since a couple of parents had complained. So my uncle had joined us that day for dinner and he asks my dad "" Are you talking about the adopted kid?"". My mom gets mad at my uncle and tells us not to mention it in front of Timmy, regardless of how mad we were. I went home and me and my brother started making jokes about Timmy being adopted. But I told him, never to say it to Timmy. I loved my parents, so I assumed, it would be pretty bad to make jokes about adoption.
The next day, me and my brother were at the park. We were kicking the ball around when Timmy comes and starts taunting us. He goes "" does the little baby miss his Pokemon cards"" to my little brother. Timmy is a little chubby,so i go "" get lost fatty"". This pisses Timmy off, he pushes me to the ground and starts kicking me. My little brother tries to help me out, so Timmy slaps him , on the side of the head. My little brother is crying. So i get really pissed and punch him on the stomach. He clutches his stomach , and now his mom comes and shouts at us. I am not sure how much she saw , but she tell us to stop picking on Timmy. He is taller and fatter than us, but she still thinks he is the victim. So while she pulls him away, he get a cheap shot in. I try to retaliate, but she pushes me away. That when I said the one of the worst things I ever said: 
 ""Bitch , you can have your ugly bastard child. I hope he dies , you ugly bitch. There is a a reason why you have no husband, because of your ugly and fat. Plus your son is a piece of shit. I hope you have a refund coupon at the adoption shop, because they gave you something made of shit."" Then I look at Timmy "" That's right Timmy, you were adopted. Your mad of shit because , you came out of your mom's butthole. But since you were shit , you parent's didn't want you. So they gave you away. That's also the reason you parent's got divorced. Because your Dad doesn't like shit."" 
 After finishing it , me and my brother ran , while Timmy asked his Mom if he was adopted and if that's why his Dad left. I still feel bad about saying it. It was pretty shitty of my. His Mom later called that night sobbing and told on me. My dad whopped me that night, but also explained to me the power of words. He explained to me how hurtful what I said was. That made me feel worse than the whopping. He also told me to apologize to Timmy. Timmy was not the same after that either. He got a lot more mellow after that and eventually just looked sad.

The phrase ""Allahu akhbar"" is also the opening to the azan, or call to prayer.

The truck must have been doing 80 miles per hour down a rural highway and the horse just stepped out of the woods and hung its head out across the road.

I just saw break lights come on and there was a large brown mass writhing in the road. As I got closer, I could see it was a horse, and the head had been COMPLETELY torn off. The neck was shooting blood like a fire hose. I'm talking a 20 foot gush that sprayed all over the side of my car as I drove past it. I got out to check on the driver and he was in shock, had no idea what had just happened.

I've never seen animals that freaked out before in my life. They were screaming and bucking and tripping over one another. It was like they understood exactly what they had seen. I guess the dead horse was one of their friends that had somehow managed to escape from the pen. Anyway, I snapped a few cell phone pictures because I was sure that nobody would believe me when I told them about it. Also, I found the horse's head - it had been thrown about 60 feet away from the body in the ditch. I had nightmares about this whole ordeal for weeks afterwards.

AskReddit,c16nrru,"Back when I was a wee lad of 17, and in my first serious relationship, the girl I was with decided to invite me over under the pretence that she wanted to cook a meal for us. 
 Her mother being out of town, and myself being a hungry teenager, I of course, readily accepted. 
 Upon arrival, I was met with an odour most foul, one which I can only describe as a mixture of week-old sweat socks, and Cthulhu's loins, emanating from the kitchen.  My girlfriend announced that we were to have tuna casserole, and proceeded to explain away the surprise olfactory rape with: ""I'm trying a new recipe!"" ...with those five innocent words, my fate was sealed. 
 We sat down for the meal, and I, somewhat apprehensively, began to explore the culinary disaster laid out before me.  Upon an initial visual inspection, the aforementioned odour suddenly took a back seat to what I can only describe as pubic-like fibrous strands, weaving a tapestry of horror, as if Satan himself had placed his unshorn scrotum on a plate in front of me, daring me to take that first succulent bite. 
 At this point, any normal human being would kindly excuse themselves, run, or attempt to perform an exorcism, but I was young, naive, and horny.  The only thing between me, and the inevitable boinking like rabbits, was Satan's tuna casserole-sack.  So I ate it.  The whole thing.  The whole, horrible, atrocious abomination. 
 An hour and some wine later, I felt pretty okay.  At this point, she suggested we go to her room and ""watch a movie"".  Excitement welled up inside of me (among other things), and I agreed.  Before the opening credits had even finished, we were doing what comes naturally to unsupervised, and slightly tipsy, teenagers. 
 A few positions in, and we decided to switch to doggy-style.  i was feeling pretty good, and this was feeling pretty awesome.  I felt like I was about explode! ...in mid-thrust, I seductively moaned ""I think I'm gonna..."", and leaned closer in to finish the sentence.  It was then, that I felt something powerful, rumbling deep inside of me, and there was nothing I could do to hold it back.  I once again spoke, but with an outcome different than the original one I had intended: ""I think I'm gonna.... BLEURGH!"" 
 It was like a rainbow.  A greasy, hot, muddy rainbow of casserole, Satan's scrotum, and wine, all down her back.  When it began to pool around her bottom, she sat up--understandably shaken--and the noise of two warm bodies and semi-digested casserole and stomach fluids coming together... oh god, that sound... I still have nightmares about it. 
 In the end, we slowly drifted apart... cleaned up, and never really spoke to each other much after the incident.

AskReddit,c5hfzqr,"When I was in 5th grade I pulled the craziest shit ever. We were on the bus from swimming practice and I was sitting at the back of the bus with my classmates. Now one of these said classmates was Indian and (as you would image) had dark skin, let's call him Daniel. Now I have absolutely NO idea how the conversation got to this point, but I ended up calling him a ""nigger"". Let me note here that I had no idea what it meant. I probably heard it on TV or something and was compelled to say it. Daniel informed me of the fact that I shouldn't say that, and that it was bad. I was convinced it wasn't bad and continued to say it repeatedly; something along the lines of 
 ""It's not bad, I can say it how much I want, nigga, nigga, nigga..."". 
 Then, of course Daniel says that he's going to tell on me, and I kind of shut up for the rest of the bus drive. 
 So, we're in the school now and I notice Daniel talking to the teacher outside. I try to focus on my work and act like nothing happened. The teacher, Mr. Kirkwood (real name, not even kidding) calls me outside and I'm thinking 'Oh, I'm going to get into a little trouble, what's the worst that can happen?' And as Daniel walks inside of the classroom, Mr. Kirkwood starts shouting at me. 
 ""How DARE you do that?! WHO do you think you are!""etc. 
 Of course, I break up in tears, being ten and having nobody except my mom ever shout at me before. He takes me by the hand and leads (read; drags) me to the principle's office. I don't remember exactly what he said, but the principle was very calm about the matter. He informs me that they are sending an E-Mail to my parents, and they need me to get a note signed by my mom. The note explained exactly what I did. 
 This is where my devilish 5th grade brain went to work. I am still very surprised at what my 10 year old mind came up with. So, I come home, first thing I do, is log onto my mothers E-Mail. I knew the password since the computer log-on was the same (or something like that). I've used a computer before and was actually pretty fuckin' savvy (for a 10 year old) now that I think about it. So, I continue to permanently delete the E-Mail which was sent to my mother. 
 That was half the work done. Now I needed a signature from my mom to sign the sheet of paper which explained everything I had done. In 5th grade we had these reading assignments we had to do. Every book we read, we had to have our parents sign it. So, I go up to my mom and acquire the signature for a book I was pretty much done with. Now, if you put up a paper up to a glass window, the light from outside would make the contrast between the ink and the white around it much more obvious. If you put up another piece of paper to the one you're already holding up, you can effectively trace the ink that's on the first sheet of paper, onto the second one. This is exactly what I did to replicate my Mom's signature on the note. I remember a girl on the shuttle which I took everyday taught me this trick to replicate signatures. 
 In the following days I gave the principle the note, which stated that I called a dark-skinned classmate a nigger. That was the most emotionally stressful week of my entire lower-school career. 
 To this day (I'm 16 now; 11th grade) my Mom has no clue of the accident which happened all those years ago.","Called classmate a nigger, got in the deepest shit at school, parents never found out."

She had a billiards table and a ping pong table downstairs in the basement. At night, it'd sound like people were playing when no one else was down there. There was also a night where a cup went flying out of the cupboard. 
 When I was 13, I had lost my dad to lung cancer. My cousin, who was living in the apt below us at the time, apparently goes into trances. I was sitting at home while family took care of funeral preparations and I received a phone call from my dad, in his voice. He gave me instructions to give to my siblings and mom and told me where he had hidden a few items, like money, or his gun. I ran downstairs to check on my cousin and her kids were crying, she was knocked out on the floor, and according to her oldest kid, she was hovering off the floor. I don't know how much of that last statement was true. She did the same thing again when her father died. He spoke to me as well.",I've had dishes fly around me and my dead dad called me from beyond the grave.
AskReddit,c9x3lg7,"Can you imagine 4 children between the ages of say, 1-6? It would be madness, and your SO would punch himself in the face repeatedly for thinking that that would be doable. I mean, some people DO manage it... but they're so sleep deprived they've gone insane. Besides, that's assuming you would want to truck on after the first year of your first child's life. You would just look at that little ball of joy and sleeplessness and think, ""3 more? No fucking way. I won't sleep for 10 years at least."" 
 That being said, you DO have some time. 20 is on the young side to have kids - just my personal opinion, my mom had me when she was 22 and she has said that I was the best thing to ever happen to her, but she really wishes she had waited a couple more years so she could have traveled more, finished college and just experienced more before settling down... That's not to say that after kids you'll never do fun things again, but obviously your entire life shifts, and priorities rearrange. You know all of this, and you don't need to hear it from a stranger on the internet, but at your age, there is still some time to enjoy the freedom of your youth, finish your education, see some more of the world. My best friend is my age (23), and her son just turned 2 last month. She loves him more than anything else in this world, as any mother should, but she too regrets not waiting. 
 Just a thought, and just my opinion. At 23 years old, I know that a baby right now would be more responsibility than I want at this time in my life. I love kids, and I want 3-4, just like you. My Godson is the light of my life, I can't imagine how it feels and I can't wait to feel the love a mother has for her child. But I know that before I can raise a little me, I need all my ducks in a row. And then some extra ducks behind that. Because parenting is the hardest thing we'll ever do, and the chances of fucking it up are too great to rush into things. 
 If I sounded like a condescending douchenozzle, I'm genuinely sorry, I'm not much older than yourself... I've just seen too many friends these last few years rush into families because they felt that they were ready... no harm in waiting a little bit longer:)

AskReddit,cefuk4i,"I didn't drink anything until the end of my freshman year in college. Yes, that's not a very long time to wait in a vacuum, but most of my friends started drinking in high school, and I was one of maybe two guys in my pledge class for my fraternity who didn't ever drink anything (the other being my roommate and closest friend, who didn't drink until he was 21) 
 I didn't drink for a variety of reasons; a few religious, but mostly because both my mom and dad's side of the family had some fairly gnarly stories about problem drinking. Though my parents didn't actively dissuade me from drinking in college, I have too many memories of my uncle calling the house drunk in the middle of the night, wanting to read us some of his poetry. 
 I broke down, eventually, because of a girl I was dating. I had dated a few girls beforehand who had drank, and I had no interest in it but supported them regardless of whatever they wanted to do and made sure to not make it an issue. My first serious girlfriend in college recognized that she didn't want to drink unless I was drinking, which was a nice thought, until at some point I felt a very unintended pressure to have a drink. 
 Long story short, I dipped my feet in. A beer with a trusted friend, one beer at a party with her (so she could have a few shots with her female friends), and then the tour de force, which was a big end of the year party that the whole school attended (a undie/naked run, if you will.) No one really did this thing sober, and so both her and I got drunk. 
 If I had felt uncomfortable or forced into it at this point, I would've marked my first drunken experience up to a mistake and walked away from it. But I really enjoyed it. Plus it was the perfect time in my life for this experiment; no hangover, no parents to go home to, and me and my girlfriend were much more eager to hop (stumble) into bed once we got home and mark a few new things off of our checklist. 
 There's nothing really profound to say about why I drink. I do it for a few reasons. Socially, it's fun; it makes me loosen up, makes me worry less, makes me laugh more, generally keeps me warm, and I tend to be a bit more creative and goofy. Hell, I even like the taste of a good beer or brown liquor. There's also some downside; sometimes little things piss me off, sometimes I text people too much and say things I shouldn't, and sometimes (often) I make bad decisions. 
 The hidden secret here, at least for me, seems that it's a really nice device that helps make my 20's that much more enjoyable, but is not something I want to continue in my 30's. The best night I've had with my friends involve drinking the right amount of alcohol, having random adventures, eating ridiculous foods, running to the beach, and having incredibly in depth conversations. It makes a time in my life that, where meeting people is awkward and flirting is even worse, get slightly easier. I just don't want to be drinking scotch in my 50's or 60's for anything other than a sleeping aid.","I started drinking later than my friends, but enjoyed it when I did.

AskReddit,cb1hzhq,"Sorry, your comment was just so absurd that I genuinely thought it was a troll account. I have some time on my hands so I'll break this down bit by bit. Let's read the offending comment again, shall we? 
 >Especially mansplainers who assume any woman they have a conversation with is coming in with an 8th grade education. 
 Remove the obvious gender inclination there and you have a perfectly reasonable comment: 
 >Especially those who assume anyone they have a conversation with is coming in with an 8th grade education. 
 Fine and dandy up to now. Why did Nymph13 feel the need to say that? Both genders do it and I'm saying that because it's happened to me. So, RapedtheDucaneFamily (I'll get to your overreaction to this username in a minute, bear with me) sarcastically points out, quite rightfully so: 
 >Yep, only men do this. 
 Just pointing out the unneeded generalization there, yes? I'm telling you now, if the comment had been about women it'd have been you pointing it out, and quite rightly so. However, you then come up with this: 
 >Rape joke in user name, oversensitive about generalizations about men... 
Spin... Spin... 
No posts in any of the MR subreddits, but you do have a choice comment in your history that suggests you think racism against white people is a thing. 
 Let's break it down: 
 >Rape joke in user name, oversensitive about generalizations about men... 
 This sentence is so daft in itself I'm struggling to find where to start. You comment about a reference to the media in someone's username, which is inherently oversensitive, then you go out on one about how he's being oversensitive? Are you having a laugh? You then make another comment about it, which is just so condescending it's downright rude. The fact that you don't even address his comment and just draw it off as 'oversensitive about generalizations about men' is sickening. You'd have thrown an absolute shitstorm if the initial comment had been the other way (and don't tell me you wouldn't have), and it wouldn't have been an 'overreaction' at all, because it's complete and utter bollocks. 
 >Spin... Spin... 
 Is this a reference I don't get or some inane filler you threw in because you don't have any actual argument versus his post, so you opted for the passive aggressive route instead? (that's what motivated me to make my initial comment, as it's the sort of demeaning attitude you see  from the garden-variety Tumblr SJW which ironically fits perfectly into [this definition]( 
 >No posts in any of the MR subreddits 
 And if he had, what would that imply? Think carefully before you answer this one. 
 >but you do have a choice comment in your history that suggests you think racism against white people is a thing 
 You're implying it isn't. Of course it is. It might not involve violence or lynching or the other sick malarkey of the extremist groups of the (thankful) past, but that's no reason to ignore it. What's your argument to say it doesn't exist? Is it because the white race is notorious for oppressing others in the past? That's absolutely no excuse to condone the opposite. The keyword is ' past '. The world has moved on.","The irony of your comment when the subject is 'People that patronize you when they're WRONG'.

AskReddit,c14cody,"There was this chick I knew, we'll call her ""H"".  Basically her boyfriend (let's call him ""jackass"") got into some financial trouble and she had asked to borrow $10k from me to get him in the clear.  Normally this is something I would immediately say no to.  Loaning money to friends is just a terrible idea unless you're of the mindset that you'll never get it back.  But she's been my friend for longer than I can remember and she was convinced jackass was 'the one'.  So I spoke with the bf, we came to terms and I loaned him the money. 
 A week later, jackass breaks up with her. 
 Now I'm not the vindicitive type.  She swears up and down that she'll pay me back, but I excuse her from the debt.  I specifically spoke with the bf to make it absolutely clear the debt was on him and the timeframe for repayment.  So when the first payment was due I gave him a call and surprisingly enough he came up with the proper amount. 
 Now this is where things get rocky.  I don't have any contact with him until the following month when his next payment is due.  I give him a call and it goes to VM.  Call back the next day, and his cell is disconnected.  Of course, this doesn't surprise me at all and it was something I was prepared for.  I knew he frequents strip clubs and it just so happens that I know a fair few strippers/bouncers.

AskReddit,c8vso8m,"For me, she did a complete 180 from our routine. 6 year relationship. 
She had gone on a Encinada(sp) cruise with 3 of her newly single friends for about 3 days. After that, she acted like a different person. 
 I had my own place, so she was at my house minimum 5 nights a week, usually staying over. We were inseparable. Often talked of getting a place together and marriage. Now we were younger, at this time i was 24 and she was 22 so our relationship started at a young age. 
 Fast forward to her return from mexico, almost instantly i saw a difference in her personality. Nights together went from >5 to maybe 1 or 2 and she NEVER stayed over anymore. Nights where we had plans to go on a date night or something, maybe half the time shed call and ask if it was ok if she went out with her friends instead, usually to bars (she wasnt a huge drinker before so this worried me). Other nights she'd show up to my house hours late and drunk, or not show up at all and tell me the next day that she had drank too much and passed out at a friends. 
 Now im not stupid, I knew something was up but couldn't get her to admit anything. Then one weekend we had plans to spend it together(I had to coerce a woman to spend time with me where before, she refused to leave my sight) and she just never showed up.

 So let me address your other point. I did comment that not it wouldn't be worth putting up with drunk people without being tipped and I stand by that comment. 
 While it is not exactly the same as dealing with violent schizos, it would be naive to think someone working in a bar doesn't have to deal with irrational and violent people, that's the nature of alcohol. 
 When you get a large group of people and add alcohol they devolve into wild animals acting only on their baser instincts. I deal with all kinds of people from your run of the mill angry drunks to the kids who don't know  their limits and puke anywhere and everywhere.

 Oh and if your going to order a mixed drink and then complain that it's weak because you can't taste the alcohol then you should be tarred and feathered and run out of town. You won't taste it if the BT is good at their job. If you want to taste the alcohol put down the 17 year old white girl drink and order Johnny Walker black, neat, like a fucking man and save me the effort. 
 Sorry, I'm just free styling now. Any rate, I was still fired up from before when you commented and I didn't quite read your comment thoroughly enough. I saw it, I didn't read it I guess. So I do apologize for being a dick, but while we're on the topic. Everyone has their own little cross to bear, don't assume your job is any less stressful than anyone elses. 
 Just to nail part of my original point home, you DO NOT have to tip at 90% of places. If you don't want to, you don't have to. I'd take a customer who doesn't tip but acts right over an asshole who tips any day. 
 edit  an example would be British people. We get a lot of British folks where I work. British people don't tip, its not because they are cheap but they do not tip in the UK. I heard it has to do with gratuity already being included in the price but I've never asked anyone from the UK. So when I get someone from the UK I'm not getting a tip. I know that, but I also know they will not be rude like some of my fellow Americans and I know they know their limit and won't cause a scene. People from the UK are some of my favorite customers even though they don't tip. Not tipping is fine, but don't act like an entitled douche which is way too common in our culture. 
 Also a pro tip, a spicy coke is captain morgan and coke. The first time one of those UK dudes said that to me I looked at him like he had a dick growing out of his forehead.

He does get back to me within 3 days. Mind you I have waited 6 weeks, in Sweden where this happened they have guidelines of 3 weeks as reasonable repair time for electronics. I point this out and the manager tells me that Blaupunkt decided to recall it and refund it.
Since I know my swedish laws I happen to know that they need to refund me an EQUIVALENT product, that is a stereo for 1000$ and not 300$ which I bought it.
So I tell the manager about it and he says that of course I am going to get a 1000$ stereo back. Arrive at the store to get my refund only to find out that I will only get 300$ and that I have the same day to pick another stereo. In sweden this is illegal, you are supposed to get your money if you want and there is a grace period of 2 weeks BY LAW. They don't give a shit and force me to pick a stereo for 300$ in a couple of hours. 
So I have to pick another stereo that I dont want and with all the debating back and forth I spend like 5 hours in the store on a saturday without eating. Come back home pissed of as hell and write a report on well known customer pricing site. The manager reponds and claims that he offered to give me a replacement one and pretty much tries to put the blame on me. I reply on the forum and give the asshole a scolding over the phone.
Blaupunkt had never cancelled or refunded the stereo I finally got a new replacement after threatening to report them to our consumer advocacy ministry. The entire ordeal took like 3-4 months and they made me feel like an asshole through the entire process. This was in 2007 I have never bought shit from them again and I have stopped many of my friends and family from ever buying from that chain again. There are now rumors of Media Markt exiting the swedish market. Serves those assholes right.","Bought a fancy stereo at Media Markt, it broke shitty customer service tries to blow me on my cash and product. Manager lies to me, I threaten to report the store.

 I would suggest that there is no mass group called  people  that is somehow separate or outside of the subgroups. Rather, there are only a whole bunch of different subgroups, and those together make up all people. So next time you see someone hating on ""hipsters,"" realize that they are not outside their own group.

AskReddit,cbr5qiy,"Nobody has done anything really bad to me. Some neighbors stole some stuff from me when I was little but I got it back. Though I have a story about being the shitty guest. 
 It was an exceptionally crappy day at work back in 2009 so I went to my neighbors house to play xbox and drink beer with them. I lost count of the beers at 7 and I know I drank at least 14+ in a short span of time as that's when my  neighbors lost count of my drinking. Well my neighbors leave the room and I don't know where they are. The very next thing I know I feel vomit coming up. I cover my mouth and run to the bathroom and vomit all over the place when at the same time the force of my puke caused my body to tense up so hard that I shat my pants. 
 This goes on for what felt like several minutes. When I'm done I realize I'm covered in vomit and my pants are full of shit, completely terrified of being found this way I make a mad drunken stagger for the door before anyone can see me. I fucking ninja out of their house having trashed their toilet with my sick, get in my car, and drive home sitting in my own excrement. I am so drunk that at five miles per hour I am swerving all over the road swearing up and down that I will not make it home on this 200 foot drive down the street drive to my house. 
 Finally I pull into my driveway after 45 harrowing seconds of pure 5mph terror and several near misses where I almost ran into parked cars. I seriously can not express this enough I was so drunk I could not drive a car in a straight line at 5mph for 200 feet. 
 I run into my house go to the toilet continue puking and shitting myself. Then as I go to clean up I reach up to take my hat off and fuck it all if I hadn't puked so hard I got vomit on top of my hat while I was still wearing it. 
 I avoided my neighbors like the plague for weeks after that and never told them the full story for 6+ months once I was sure it was too far in the past for them to get mad at me.","Nearly crashed my car while covered in vomit and sitting in my own excrement.

 This has been said over and over again on reddit, but chances are you can't just blame the rest of the world for your misfortunes. You definitely seem to think you're worth more than what you're being offered at the moment, which may or may not be true. ""Self-proclaimed intellect"" has little value in any workforce. Aside from debating with yourself while masturbating. You need to turn that into a valuable skill that is desirable in the workforce. If you HAVE a skill (you're in your mid-twenties, plenty of time to have gone to college, university, or a trade school of some sort) and there's no work in the area, MOVE TO WHERE THERE IS WORK. That should seem like a no-brainer. 
 I have a feeling you lost the weight because you assumed that by doing so a new dating world would open up for you, people would see you for who you really are and the kind of women you want would just line up to meet you. The problem is, people were already seeing you for who you are. All you've done now is made the package a little nicer. Work out your personal skills, man. Get to know who you really are as a person. Explore what you have to offer. What you REALLY have to offer, don't say to yourself that you're funny and cool and girls should be all over you. Are you REALLY that nice? Or are you a passive aggressive motherfucker that seem to wander reddit's hallways like rats in a sewer? 
 If you know who you are, then who are you hanging out with? Are your friends on the same page as you? If you're pushing them away, probably not. It's time to get out and meet some new people. Find your interests and you will find people that share them. This is called ""doing what you like"" and allow you to meet ""people like you"". This a big step in ""being happy"". I strongly recommend it. 
 > I'm seriously considering joining the military just so I can turn off my higher reasoning and let my reptile brain take over. I'm hungry for an emotional connection, and I'm pushing my friends away as they fail to fill that void for me.

AskReddit,c6z5f6p,"A thousand times YES!!!!!!! 
 As someone who has received public assistance before,  REPORT THEM .  Every time someone cheats like this, it does two things: 
 
 It reinforces the stereotype that people receiving assistance are lazy or gaming the system. 
 
 It takes aid away from people who  actually  need it. 
 
 
 I'm totally for someone who needs aid getting it.  I totally understand that just because someone is getting aid doesn't mean they can only subsist on rice and beans or can't have a little relief or fun to keep up their morale.  But when someone is cheating the system, taking my taxpayer money when they don't need it?  That is fraud and needs to be reported. 
 And, as a side thought, if you are poor and qualify for aid of some kind, apply for it!  Your taxpayer dollars fund the system.  There's no good reason you shouldn't benefit from your investment when you need it.  It's like paying for car insurance, but you won't file a claim because that's just not ""right"" or ""how you were raised.""  File for it!  If they say no, you're in the same place you are now.  If they say yes, that may be  more groceries to feed yourself or the child or health coverage when you need it most.  I had insurance when my first child was born so that was covered.  I was laid off before my second child was born and if it wasn't for Medicaid, we could never have afforded the medical bills.  Hell, we'd probably still be paying on them now...

AskReddit,cmtrmmv,"Obligatory 'Not a teacher', apologies but this is a memory I'll always have. It regards my dad and what he did during his 'retirement'. 
 When my dad left his previous job, he decided to become a high school teacher. I was in 6th grade when this all went down. 
 He taught math to underprivileged kids. He's always been a math genius, and wanted to give back. Not in the Dangerous Minds way, but because he grew up with a similar background. 
 All of his students loved him, because he also coached a school team a lot of his students were on. He was pretty laid back for a teacher, and actually cared about them. 
 One student he had was, well, I'll call him Justin. One day, as my dad was leaving school, he saw Justin going through trashcans (My memory is hazy, but that's a detail that stood out.) Our family was quite well off, but my dad, as I said, had it rough growing up. Justin was also on the team dad coached. 
 Now, my dad went to one of the best schools in the country on a sports scholarship. He knew Justin was talented, smart, and really great on the team. 
 So my dad approached Justin. After some embarrassment, Justin told my dad he was so poor that this was one of the ways he supported his family-by going through trashcans looking for bottles to recycle. 
 Dad began to bring clothes to school. Justin introduced him to his dad, and my dad vowed to help Justin in any way he could to get him the one place he wanted to go-college. 
 Dad had, and still has, connections to his alma mater. Introduced Justin to them too. They loved him. They saw how good he was on the team my dad coached, how smart Justin was, and the same potential dad saw. 
 My brother and I didn't know much about Justin, but one day my mom told us everything. My dad is a humble man, but his heart is huge. He gave Justin and his dad clothes, brought them meals, and helped out with job applications. Justin and his dad weren't lazy in terms of working. Circumstances are a bitch, you know? 
 I learned that Justin not only got into college, full scholarship, but his dad got a job. My dad didn't give him a job, just support and what the basic needs of both of them couldn't afford (Clothes, food, transportation on some occasions.) 
 My dad doesn't talk about it. He doesn't want to be seen as some kind of Superman for this. My dad just saw one of the kids he cared about in a bad situation that was no fault of his own. 
 Dad eventually came out of retirement-he had been assisting people in his first field the whole time, so it was an easy transition-so he no longer teaches today. He does mentor one of my mothers students though. 
 No matter what, my dad is my hero. Not because of what he did, even though he could have ignored it like most teachers did. He did it because it was the right thing to do-helping people has always been his purpose. 
 Sorry this was long. Justin, if you're out there, send me a message and I can pass it on to my dad. If this was too personal to share, apologies. You made an impact on my life as well. You got to where you are on your own, and best of luck for everything.","Read it. Again Justin-my dad remembers you to this day as one of his best students. 
 EDIT: I'm so surprised by all the positive and, well, all the response! I'll pass on to my dad that people on 'That Kevin Story Site' -What he calls Reddit, because he liked [The Story of Kevin]( people really like how he helped out Justin."

AskReddit,cg3r7lr,"This is needlessly complicating things, in a bond-villain sort of way. Do you have any idea about how hard it is to fly, land, refuel and then take off a modern airliner? This is a Boeing 777, not a Ford Fiesta you can drive around discretely, fill it up at the self-service pump and park anywhere unnoticed. Also the plane’s systems would quickly deteriorate if it was placed in prolonged storage without proper maintenance. 
 So you’re one of the bad guys and you managed to get your hands on a huge, fully fueled aircraft – either by kidnapping the plane or coopting one or both of the pilots. That in itself is a big f..king deal, and really hard to pull off in the post-9/11 era. You’re already on the air, why on earth would you risk the maximum impact of just flying the plane into a heavily populated area and then knocking over a building? 
 There were plenty of interesting targets on the flight’s fuel range. But nooo , you say. Let’s risk being shot down by flying over India, or China or whoever, or having our inexperienced hijacker pilot running into some bad weather and crashing into the sea; or wrecking the plane while landing in some remote, poorly maintained runway somewhere.  Then , if you’re holding the passengers for ransom, let’s deal with the logistics of confining, controlling and feeding 200+ people for over a week.  Or , if you’re only interested on the plane, let’s try to hide it from the butt-load of people who are looking for it with an increasingly incredible amount of resources (Planes! Boats! Satellites!) and dealing with mounting international pressure whilst simultaneously risking ground witnesses coming forward (if you’ve ever lived close to an airport landing corridor you can imagine how hard it would be to land a plane that size discreetly), like some goat herder looking for the reward money.  Then  let’s worry about keeping the plane airworthy while being parked somewhere for 9 days (and counting – do you think terrorist maintenance personnel are trained by Boeing)?  Then  let’s work out how to purchase, store and pump the insane amount of fuel  - over 170,000 litres, or 45,000 US gallons needed to get it back up in the air.  Then  let’s cross our fingers and hope that our inexperienced pilot is able to take off successfully and fly the plane towards our selected destination unnoticed, to carry out our nefarious plan, whatever it may be. Or if we did manage to coopt one or both of the professional pilots - both of which had a pretty good life back home – let’s hope we can keep them motivated to carry on with the plan. 
 All of this makes for an  extremely  unlikely scenario. Why would you jeopardize such an opportunity for instant mayhem by risking so many things that can go wrong? Maaaybe if you were being aided by some rogue state, but even then… And all this for what? If you had access to some sort of nuclear device, you wouldn’t need a 777 to drop it, especially if you had the support of some dic(k)tatorship somewhere, who could eliminate all this hassle and just give you a plane.","The plane is likely at the bottom of the ocean and not at the hands of Dr. Evil.

AskReddit,cehne40,"This is perhaps one of the biggest hurdles I have gone through when I found out I was gay. 
 By the time I found out I was gay (13), I was not exactly the best example of a Roman Catholic follower. After fourth grade, my family stopped going to Church and rarely attended (even though I still attended Catholic elementary school) and when I did go to the services,  I tuned out the homily, looked at all the glittering pictures of the saints above and eagerly awaited the bread and wine for a quick snack before leaving. Strangely enough, I felt like I had broken a relationship with God at the point, especially when the news highlights about gay marriage were about the increasing bans and sermons against gay people. For a while, I believed them and became utterly depressed about how I was an 'sin' against the world, to the point where I did contemplate suicide on a daily basis. 
 About the time high school came around, I found a great group of friends who came from different religious backgrounds, whether it be Baptists, Neo-Paganism, Jewish and so on, that really opened my eyes to how many religions there were in the world praying to different or the same God, despite differences in rules and customs. At that point, I came to the conclusion that God would not judge someone based on the religious affiliation if they life were filled with good works that helped , not hurt, the cause of humanity. That rule alone eventually grew into bigger questions of religion and the philosophy of God, to which I am still trying to understand today. 
 Fast forward to today, where I recently graduated from college. I learned plenty of information regarding Catholic history and queer studies that really helped me understand what the Bible said about homosexuality (Short answer: very little to none/uncertain). My education of religion and philosophy has shown plenty of weaknesses of the ideology of religion, but this has only strengthen my spirituality. There comes times where I will fundamentally disagree on several tenants of the Catholic faith, to the point where I believe that I might as well ascribe to being a non-denominational Christian. That said, my faith is one of the biggest factors and constantly thought about topics I  think about almost on a daily basis. 
 From this whole discovery, it is not so much that I have to come to terms as an 'abomination' within the eyes of the Lord, but rather to discover what my relationship with God will be with this new information. I have moved passed the phase that my sexual orientation is a one-way ticket to Hell, mostly because I think it greatly interferes with God being seen as an all-loving, all merciful, greater being (as well as the 'good jobs' intention I mentioned earlier). The struggle now is moving towards an ideal and system of faith I feel comfortable with that firmly establishes my relationship with Him, regardless of who I am today and with emphasis of what good will I do for the world.","I once became depressed when I found out I was gay and an 'abomination' towards God, but have moved passed this phase with the help of friends and education of faith and philosophy.

 I actually gave myself panic attacks lying in bed thinking I was going to die. I had heard stories about my uncle who died when he was ten of a missing heart valve.

 I am a VERY non violent person. Not a pussy but I dont like hurting people. 
 Anyways I am in hospital and the teacher is there too being checked for head injuries. 
 Back at school next day with a caste on my wrist and it was never mentioned again until I had french... 
 me ""can i go toilet miss""
Frenchy ""no""
me "" i will piss on your table""
frenchy "" go to the head teachers office""
me ""fuck you"" 
 So I went down there and waited. After frenchy and head talked I got booted out for 3 days for throwing the table but not the convo I had just had.

AskReddit,c9uo1io,"I posted this once before, so sorry if any of the three people who saw it are also here today: 
 Well, here it is, the most uncomfortable night of my life: It's the last night my friends and I have together before we all go off to college. We're just hanging out, you know, we go grab some booze and eat some shitty mexican food, then head over to my friends house to get our drank on. I thought that this was a bad idea because his parents were home, but, as per usual, my concerns were shot down by everybody else. 
 Anyway, we're having a great time, we go grab some oatmeal creme pies at the grocery store and sit down to watch some south park, when all of a sudden the guy whose house we're at starts feeling a bit sick. Now, he had more to drink than any of the rest of us, but not too much, we thought. Well, he goes off to the bathroom, and we stay watching south park. 
 So then his mom comes down to say good night to her son. Who's in the bathroom. Probably vomiting. So we try to downplay his illness, but she goes into the bathroom to check on him all the same. Wellllll, we're all a bit nervous at this point, and with good reason, because the look on his mom's face when she comes out of the bathroom is soul-crushing. Just defeated. She asks us to help him up to his bedroom, so we all head over to the bathroom to get him. 
 In the few minutes that we had left him in there, his condition has deteriorated noticeably. He's pale, he can barely move, he looks like a ghost. We carry him up to his room and tuck him in. I make sure to remind him to stay on his side. We head down, and are greeted by his mother, who invites us to all sit down and have a talk.
Shit.
Well, the good news is that she's not too worried about her son, but god damn that was an awkward conversation. We didn't lie to her about anything, so that probably made it better. We all say our goodbyes and GTFO. 
 Thought the story was over? Wrong. Dead wrong. 
 As we leave, who should be waiting outside the house but this girl who we had drunkenly texted as a joke. Now, we could've just told her to split, but she appeared to be tweaking on several different pills, none of which she could remember taking, nor when she had taken them. I've never seen anyone more out of it than her.
She's going to stay over at her friend's place, but her phone is dying, and hey, thommyhobbes, isn't your house within walking distance? Do you have a charger there? 
 Fuck my friends. 
 So we head over to my house, where one of my friends was going to be sleeping over anyway. This girl is out of her mind on these drugs. Like, completely paranoid and just flat-out nuts. We get to my house, and now it's around 2:00 or so. I run up to my parents' room and ask if it's okay for a few people to come in.
""whehhat?""
Good enough. They come on in, and we head down to the basement. We hang out for a while, and soon enough it's just me, the friend who was sleeping over (let's call him Jack), and the girl (Jill). So it's now 4 in the morning, and it's becoming increasingly clearer that Jill's friend is never coming. She decides to leave with Jack at 6, which is when he's got to go to catch his train. Okay, whatever. 
 We all settle in to sleep in the basement. I nod off, but am awoken by the sound of talking coming from the bathroom. ""ah, Jill's probably on the phone with her friend,"" I think, perhaps naively. I look over at where Jack was sleeping. Hmmm. Where the fuck is Jack? 
 I begin to realize what is going on just as I begin to hear the first sounds of Jack and Jill fucking each other's brains out in the guest bedroom. 
 What the fuck. 
 This girl had been OUT OF HER MIND not two hours ago, and now she's having sex with one of my best friends in MY basement. Wow.
I just sort of lie there stunned. I can't do anything for fear that they'll hear me getting up. As the hours pass, I begin to feel angrier and angrier. This is becoming just rude. 
 Finally, 6:00 comes around. I flip on the light and sit there expectantly.
The noises stop. 
 Jack walks out of the room. 
 He sees me. 
 He turns back to Jill. ""He totally knows,"" he whispers to her. 
 I get up and walk over to him. ""Jack,"" I say, disturbingly calmly, ""it's okay. Just get the fuck out of my house."" 
 He does so. I watch them leave, and finally head upstairs to my room. As I pass by my parents' room, my mother comes out and asks how my night was. I tell her I'll talk about it after I've had some sleep. She says ""You haven't gone to bed yet!"" 
 I hadn't. 
 Crazy fucking night.","Friend maybe got alcohol poisoning, talked about that with his mom, went back to my place to listen to my friend have sex with a drugged up lady. Didn't get to bed until 6AM."
AskReddit,c1w81au,"A few weeks ago, I dreamed I was being attacked by a pair of birds on my friend's porch.   I swatted them away, but eventually had to stop them by reaching out lightning-quick and catching one by the neck.  On closer inspection, the top of their heads had ridges like a bottle-top.  I twisted it.  It popped off, and the bird went stiff.  looking through the hole in it's skull, I could see that I was now holding a stiff, hollow, bird-shaped receptacle, full of some kind of drinkable juice.  I was too scared to drink it.  Then I threw it down and did the same check with the other one.  Same story.  Hollow, juice-filled bird.  Bottlecap for a skull. 
 I was distraught by this, so I woke up, stumbled to the computer and got on Wikipedia.  Researching this particular phenomenon, I was shocked to learn that scientists have indeed developed a chemical, called Enzyme-219 which, if present in the tissue of a living thing, upon death acts to begin an immediate liquefaction of the muscle, organ, and bone tissue, and with such speed that the existing glucose contained in the cell walls does not have time to ferment.  The result?  Kill an animal, and you can drink it.  Like a pulpy, salty protein-based juice.  I was particularly shocked to find that pharmaceutical companies are eyeing this chemical as a potential sale for animal control in various states (think, no more roadkill messes, just puddles) and will potentially screw over entire ecosystems in their rash adoption. 
 And  then  I woke up.  For real.  Took me about 8 hours to get over this one.","Inception'd myself with a realistic and relevant dream-wikipedia search, forcing me to believe the contents of  prior dream ."
AskReddit,cdaxnnq,"All over the bathroom. 
 I mean  all over . Floor, bathtub, toilet, sink, walls, ceiling. Everywhere. 
 That night my roommate and I ordered Chinese food. I hadn't eaten anything all day, so I went full on fatass mode: chicken fried rice, general taos chicken, chicken balls, half a dozen egg rolls, wantons, and a fortune cookie. 
 After all that... I wasn't full. I was  fucking stuffed . I went to bed, tossing and turning, worried about whether or not it would stay down. Eventually I slipped into blissful darkness and terrifying dreams. 
 Then, suddenly, I am wide awake, and I bolt upright. Something evil is brewing inside me, and I must banish it, lest I be destroyed in the process. I get up and run to the washroom. I can feel it rising, swiftly slipping up my throat. 
 I throw open the door. It's in my mouth. I slam my had against the wall in an attempt to hit the light switch so I can accurately aim my vomit, but alas, no dice. It's now being pushed out my mouth, no time to try the light again. Well, okay, one more attempt. With one hand I cover my mouth and force it in, the other hand swings once, twice, thrice more, never to connect with the switch. In the darkness I feel something horrible: the vomit has started to bypass my mouth and is forcibly coming out of my nose. 
 I aim at what is approximately where the toilet should be, and let go. I spray gooey, slimy, rancid chunks of partially digested Chinese food. After the initial wave leaves, I try to regain my balance and move over to turn the light on. I slip and fall backwards, landing in my own vomit. 
 The sudden movement and loss of balance sends another burst of goo flying out of my mouth as I slip back and down. It flies up, up, up... And then it comes down, down, down. Well, most of it does, anyways. A good portion of it stuck to the ceiling and slowly drips down as I continue the dance of the sick. 
 Long story shorter, I end up clearing out my stomach after about half an hour. I proceed to finally turn on the light, and see that I have gotten puke  EVERYWHERE . 
 All through this I was constantly saying things like ""Oh god, oh Jesus Christ why, oh fuck"". Later that day, my roommate told me he had had a dream about zombies puking everywhere while people screamed ""oh god why"".","Vomiting in the dark leads to it going everywhere, including the ceiling. Also barf zombies."
AskReddit,ccs0s92,"Okay, so since this is, AFAIK, the only comment I've made since I joined up a couple months ago that has a score lower than -1 (and most of my scores are positive), I guess I'll explain myself. 
 Firstly, I'll say that it was late at night, I've been pretty under the weather with an upset stomach and headaches the last few days, so I was a bit irritable. That doesn't  excuse  my apparent rudeness but I hope it  explains  it. 
 The sentence I quoted  was  pretty awfully written. I get the gist of it now, but taken literally, it definitely implies that OP was dating the wife's  grandmother . Also, and I guess this was my own fault of misinterpretation here, but I have only just realized that OP and his wife are still married. Ever since posting my other comment, I had thought ""while we were still dating"" was a weird way of saying ""while we were still married"" and that OP is now divorced. Again, that was probably my own fault - I now realize that it probably means ""back before my wife and I were married"". 
 
 As for ""I did not much care for the story"", I apologize for my shortness (which, as I've stated, was due to my own grumpiness). However, I stand by my sentiment. 
 Recall, if you will, every [serious] horror movie or story that you have ever heard. How many of those movies were about helplessness, with the victims being either too young, too weak, or too ill-equipped to defend themselves? 
 Probably most of them. 
 Now, tell me how many of those stories ended 25 minutes into the film with the protagonist simply turning and shooting the monster, cursing that she hadn't shot it well enough? (Bonus points if protagonist yells 'MURICA before the end credits.) 
 Yeah, probably not too many. 
 So there I am browsing these stories, some of them genuinely scary, about how strangers have broken into homes whilst the OP, as a child, feels terrified and defenseless. I come across this story... good build-up with the sinister man in the woods in the dark... and then BLAM, guy is shot,  ""Hey, it's Texas."" , and suddenly my wonderful goosebumps have all vanished.","Apologies for any offense caused by my comment, but it  was  a badly written sentence and IMO, protagonists in scary stories do not carry guns."
AskReddit,c7vkmnv,"Allstate.  In August 2011, while riding my bike, I was hit by a car that blew through a stop sign. The driver also had Allstate.  After a year of rehab we settled for less than my medical treatment costs.  They would not negotiate and based their settlement on their Colossus algorithm. 
 Later that month I was in a fender bender that was technically my fault. But because I was a customer in good standing for 6 years with good driver status, they promised no rate increase. 
 One year later (July 2012), I was hit head on by a driver that ran a red light (old lady that was taken away in an ambulance). Just sitting there at the light with my wife and 4 month old baby in the car minding our own business.  Our car was pretty wrecked and spent a month in the body shop. Damages totaled $8,000.  This happened literally 1 week after I finished treatment from the bike accident.  Needless to say my body was jacked all over again. 
 The next month (Aug 2012), still in a rental car awaiting our car to be repaired, a young guy pulled out from a side street and hit us on the side.  Again, me, wife and baby just driving along minding our own business. 
 So it's been a shitty year and a half. Now Allstate sent us a letter stating they're not renewing our policy. Our local agent tried to get an exception for us considering our circumstances but the corporation says no. They assert that they cannot recoup $30,000 they have paid on my claims. 
 After waiting for my local agent to do their thing, I now have two weeks to find a new auto insurance carrier.  Most are quoting triple what I'm paying now and some refuse to provide quotes due to my open claims. 
 I have since learned Allstate turned their back on Katrina victims, and settled with the state of NY for something like $8M for their sole reliance on Colossus to evaluate settlements.","Allstate is dropping me for being in 4 accidents in 1.5 years, 3 of which were listed no-fault of mine, because they can't recoup $30,000 (their words)."
AskReddit,ch6fehc,"My first girlfriend was like this and I didn't find out until fairly deep into our relationship. It's been half a year since I broke up with her and while I would never want to go through it again it still hurts that it turned out the way it did. I tried to help and it didn't work. 
 I already know that white knighting doesn't help any one. I think the situation is different for this girl because she was a good friend of mine in middle school until we went to two separate high schools. We lost contact at one point and I just recently heard about the kind of person she turned into and was disheartened. I just thought if there was anyway I could get in contact with her again and just ask her about it then I could help her be the great person she was before. 
 I know the only advice I'll get here is to leave her alone but it really hurts deep down to watch her self destruct.","I know white knighting is bad, I don't want to actually rescue her, just talk to her about it."
AskReddit,c0m8eqp,"Get her something nice, but not real expensive for her birthday.  Use this time to talk to her, and figure out where the relationship is at - if there really is one anymore. 
 It is a really sorry piece of crap that would wait until they received an expensive, anticipated gift to break up with someone.  You don't want a girl like that to start with.  Flip side, if it is her ""friends"" that are telling you this, maybe they may not be as good a friend with her as you thought they were...  and are deliberately sabotaging her relationship so she doesn't get the gift.  (then again, maybe her friends are just awesome, not wanting to let her gig you like that) 
 But two years in with a lot of fade in the relationship?  You shouldn't be planning on buying any really big, really significant gift.  Hell, the [anniversary tables]( of gifts for people who are actually married and not just seeing each other shows that the 2nd year gift should be cotton/china.  So the second year of seeing each other isn't nearly as significant.

AskReddit,crm24cx,"I've got a theory about this actually. When you take into account the growing city/suburban populations and the aging rural population, it seems like it all comes down to generational and geographical influences. Most people (about 70%) take their beliefs from their parents. These are your people born in the country who perpetuate their parents' conservatism, staying close to their family because of the shared ideology. However, the number of conservative youth is dwindling as the younger generations become more liberal than their parents, causing the rural older generations to cling to traditional beliefs. Those liberal youths are far more likely to go live in cities to escape mom and dad and to live with other people who share their same values, morals, and ideals. 
 This isn't a new concept, because really if you consider the past couple hundred years there is always a divergent group that flocks together and leaves behind a more conservative one. Take for example the anti-slavery republicans in the 1800's who often populated cities (it's important to note that the Republican Party was generally the more liberal of the parties for the first 50 or so years it was around). Those who were pro-slavery generally lived in rural areas and were against freeing the slaves for a practical reason: they were the main labor force. I think this may have been the root of this rural-conservative/urban-liberal situation we have going on today. It also accounts for the fact that the American south is home to so many more conservatives than the north. Not only is it generally more rural, but traditionally its inhabitants were the conservative ones (i.e. agriculture was centered there in the 1800's, while industry was in the North, as already discussed).",birds of a feather flock together and it can be traced back to the civil war.
AskReddit,c1rs5dp,"So, when I was about 12 years old, I went to one of my distant relatives house with my parents. I was out playing in their back yard, and at some point got rather thirsty. These relatives of mine were kinda southern, and just had a funny way of doing things. The had their old beat up pick up truck, and random 2 liter bottles of soda laying around in the yard nearby. Or so I thought. I was really thirsty, and too embarrassed to ask for something to drink. So I noticed a 2 liter bottle of Sprite near the car, picked it up, opened it, and started drinking it. 
 Big mistake. After about 3-5 gulps, I started to realize this wasn't Sprite, or any kind of soda. It was gasoline. You know, spare gas for their truck. Not inside a red gas container, but in a 2 liter bottle of ""Sprite."" Long story short, I threw up for hours and hours. Man was it awful.

AskReddit,cb3nrta,"Throwaway for this as I suspect my best friend knows my account. 
 About a year ago the girl that I was in-love with (for about 3-4 years) took her own life. She was dealing with a lot of emotional disorders for a long time and eventually, when faced with eviction from her hospital (her doctors thought she was better, I believe it was her safe-haven) she went up to pack up her things and hung herself in the bathroom. 
 I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for about 6 years, but this finally made me make a final decision. I am going to end my own life, there's no arguing that, it's just what I want. It's not that I want to die, it's that I have no interest in living anymore. Life it tiring.

 He went first and I easily got out.  Then it was my turn and I went ape shit on this knot tying it with at least 4 to 5 knots deep. He obviously wasn't going anywhere and this is when I came up with my sinister plan.

As I'm walking I realize that I have a heater with an open oven and 2 dogs in the house. I don't know if this can get bad real quick. I may not have enough time to wait for a locksmith, emergency services or roommates to make it to the house. 
 I bolt as fast as I can back to the house. Go into the back, put a patio chair below the kitchen window, grab a decent sized rock we had.  First hit I half assed it thinkng it wouldn't take much. Second bursts through, I throw the blanket over the bottom and climb through onto the kitchen sink.  Turn all the heat off, dogs are still alive. 
 Called my roommates to tell thme what happened. I duct tape a cardboard window on the in and outside. Call a window repair place, they have to come out to measure and come back in a few days to replace it.  Double plane has to have more work done so it takes a bit longer than single pane. 
 There was some coil that burnt out, which i have been informed not replacing air filters can do. Dude has to come back the next day to get that repaired. Window cost about $250. 
 So what's your Mr. Bean moment?",Thought my house would blow up so I broke through my kitchen window.
AskReddit,cm8h892,"Friend of mine used to work with this guy that was kind of a strange dude. He was a clean cut looking guy and kind of buff, liked to work out alot but when I say he was strange what I mean is he was the type of guy you just couldnt trust. He would always hit on my gf and then reassure me it was all in good fun. 
 I used to work at a bar and him, along with my buddy and some of the other guys they worked with would come up there often. His stepfather, who owned the company they worked at, was a regular and a big tipper so for the most part it was always good times and easy money. 
 Anyways, I'll call him Ted, wound up meeting a pretty girl, I'll call her Sally, and decided to get hitched. So Ted and Sally got married, bought a new house and decided to have a housewarming party. So Ted invites me and my buddy and several others to come over, hang out, have drinks, etc. Turns out to be kind of a small party, maybe about 15-20 of us at the most but it was casual and cool because most of us knew each other. 
 Fast forward a little bit and some of us are playing cards, some are just hanging out having drinks. Sallys best friend apparently wasnt much of a drinker and had gone into the guest bedroom to pass out. Fast forward a little more and Ted is out of sight. It is at this point Sally walks out of the guest bedroom looking completely freaked out. 
 Now I was pretty drunk at this point so some of it is hazy but I do remember seeing Sallys face and it looked like she saw a ghost. The other girls there had quickly surrounded her to find out what happened and the next thing I know we are being ushered out by some of the girls ""We should go..."" 
 Apparently Sally had walked in on Ted with his pants down and undressing Sallys best friend who was still passed out on the bed. I had always thought Ted was a beer short of a six pack and this pretty much verified that in spades. Not only did he try to rape a girl who was passed out but he did it to his new wifes best friend during their housewarming party. 
 Sally ended up leaving with her friend, along with the rest of us that night, but the truly sad part is that I heard they were still married and had children.","Guy tried to rape his wifes best friend, who was passed out, during their housewarming party."
AskReddit,c1lcp7f,"I'm the bad guy: 
 When I lived in a townhouse, one of my neighbors married a South American Woman that had two soccer mad children. 
 The back of the houses were unfenced and these two kids from her previous relationship(s) would play soccer at all hours. In the summer months, the ""smack"" sound of a kicked ball and the shrieks and screams of these two boys would start in the morning and continue until the sun set in the evenings. 
 The layout of the buildings made our back door nearer the action than that of the neighbors in question. Our complaints were laughed off, they heard the noise as ""not that bad"", from our living room it was as if they were kicking right behind us. It was awful, and it got to be all consuming. When they weren't kicking the ball, we sat on edge awaiting the noise to start. Again. 
 One day the screams were as shrill as I'd ever heard...and I lost it. I stormed out and screamed at the little bastards for what felt like an eternity. I vented. Big time. I doubt my tirade was more than ten seconds long, but when I was done I was absolutely shaking.

AskReddit,caphdke,"As a caucasian, pro-gun advocate, I'll admit that before the opening statements I thought Zimmerman was innocent.  George got piss poor treatment in the press, and the talking heads were severely biased in favor of Trayvon.  Things kept coming out about Trayvon that showed he was a person of poor character, and that sort of sealed the deal for me (i.e. he was suspended from school for drugs, vandalism, had provocative internet handles, etc.). Witnesses and evidence supported George's story, so I felt that George was innocent. 
 Then the prosecution's opening statements showed us George's attitude at the time of the killing.  George, with a fully loaded semi-automatic weapon, got out of the car to chase someone that he called a ""fucking punk,"" and an ""asshole,"" and he didn't even know the ""kid"" (George's words). 
 What happened after that is up for debate, but the  fact  is that George had the wrong attitude that night when he decided to pursue Trayvon unprovoked.  He was angry and chasing someone while ""carrying,"" and as a gun owner, I'd say that's just a  stupid fucking thing  to do.  When you have a gun on you, it does not make you a cowboy or a cop or someone of authority.  In fact, when carrying, you want to lose every argument you are in. You let someone call you names and spit in your face.  You do everything in your power to  never  have to fire your firearm at someone.  You certainly don't go looking for trouble like George did. 
 I'm sad that all this happened, and as someone that is very pro-gun, I feel like this is a great example of an armed citizen putting themselves in a position to use their firearm when they should have just walked away.  This is not was concealed carry is all about, and this kid, while probably of poor moral fiber,  didn't need to die that night.","I'm pro-gun.  I thought George was innocent, and I think he probably still is innocent in that he had to defend himself from Trayvon.

AskReddit,c82u730,"Okay, so, this is gonna be real weird so bear with me. 
 When I was a kid, about 8ish or so, I would have hallucinations while trying to sleep. These hallucinations were REALLY vivid, I could see, smell and hear everything perfectly well. 
 Each night while trying to sleep, for a period of 1-2 weeks, I would get swarmed by crabs. YES, fucking crabs. Shitloads of god damn crabs. My floors are wood, so I could hear these fuckers shuffling around marching full force towards me. They were everywhere, on my bed, on the desk, all coming towards me. I would see them and instantly freak out and get under the blanket in fetal position, pants shitting scared. (I was never afraid of crabs, so I dunno why this happened. ) 
 This continued every night for a period of 1-2 weeks or so. My parents wouldnt believe me and think that I was dreaming (in essence, I would have thought that too.) After this happened, I would sleep in my parents bed for a while. 
 After sleeping in my parents bed for a few days, I decide to sleep in my bed feeling partcularly brave after watching some cartoon (or movie, not sure.) I go to bed, lay down and try to sleep. Immediately, I get the sense of being watched. I could feel a presence in the room, but it wasnt threatening, so curiously I sat up to see whats going on. 
 I saw a huge wolf sitting in front of my closed door, at the base of my bed, gazing at me proudly. This wolf was white, with a bit of dark grey, and had the most beautiful eyes I can remember. It was sitting there, just slowly wagging his tail along the floor. I knew I could sleep easy that night. After this, everything went back to normal, havent had anything like this since then. 
 I got a wolf tattoo on my right shoulderblade when I was about 17ish because of this.

AskReddit,c51h5ud,"You are neither wrong nor right. It's a normative question, and so it is not susceptible to an objective answer. There are people who believe, for non-religious reasons, that suicide cheapens life, &c. There are more who believe the same for religious reasons. There are also those who believe that, on utilitarian grounds, we are better off with a per se rule banning suicides, based on the following reasoning. 
 First, there are people who commit suicide, but, had they lived, would regret it. These people are served by a rule against suicide. Second, there is an externality to suicide: it makes family members feel sad, it reduces economic productivity, etc. This is another argument against suicide. The flip side of this argument is that there are people who would  not  have lived to regret it; and sometimes, people are a net  drain  on society. The utilitarian argument against suicide depends on the negatives of it outweighing the positives. 
 Now, let me discuss the law. Suicide is not a fundamental right in America. In fact, assisted suicide is illegal, although there is some play: you can ""let someone die,"" due to the action/omission distinction. There is a complicated legal doctrine as to the extent of how much you can ""let"" someone die. Can you remove their tubes, or do you have to let them do it? Etc. I'm not interested in all of that, but it bears noting that, in the majority of cases, it will be elderly, sick, and disabled people to whom this inquiry is relevant, because others can easily off themselves, law or no law. It's hard to deter someone who doesn't have a taste for life from offing themselves. 
 Regarding the function of the laws, I'd say it is symbolic. But, then, all law is symbolic. Law just is the expression of social mores under the imprimatur of force. So that brings us back to square one: it's a normative question, and the voting majority in America disagree with you. That is all there is to it. I would recommend that, instead of phrasing it as a ""fundamental right,"" though, just see it as a different preference you have that you'd like society to embrace. 
 Personally, I agree with you. One reason is that the number of ""suicidal gestures"" dwarf the number of sincere suicides. A suicidal gesture occurs when somebody wants attention, so they threaten suicide. If we stopped paying attention to suicidal gestures, the harmful effects of suicidal gestures (up to, and including, accidental suicides) would dry up. Instead we fan the flames. Also my ex-girlfriend was crazy.","After a well-reasoned, if rambling, discussion of suicide laws, I end by disclosing that my ""suicidal"" ex-girlfriend was annoying, and listed me as her emergency contact."

AskReddit,ca5m4tb,"This, perhaps ironically, is why it confuses me that some people choose to treat ""cheaters"" as social pariahs. This might sound ridiculous to some of you, but I just want to explain where I see the disconnect and why. Relationships are an  aspect  of life, and like any other aspect of life, there are  individual differences  concerning desires, sense of competence, moral compass, and rate of growth. It's known that a healthy mind is one that can learn from a mistake and grow from it, but there is a strong, emotionally charged sentiment that a cheater is always a cheater, and cheaters are always evil. 
 Honestly, if my SO told me that they had never cheated on a partner, I would be worried simply because they wouldn't understand that feeling of ""dirt on the soul"" (good analogy, by the way). This is also why that ""I've never cheated"" holier-than-thou mentality is always a red flag for me: it implies  judgement based on social expectations  with little  real  thought about the individual people (cheater and cheated alike) involved or their stress and motivations. I don't believe that understanding can come before experience, and I don't think pride should come before struggle. 
 With that said, accidentally cheating is totally possible. Not for the actual action itself (which is a choice), but simply for being susceptible to that choice. Being naive with relationships, curious about others, in a state of extreme stress (positive or negative), vulnerable to pressure, in a life-transition, or having poorly met needs (including non-sexual needs) could influence someone to cheat who would otherwise not risk hurting their loved one  or themselves . Of course, there are those who can remorselessly hurt others (sexual or otherwise), but to permanently condemn all those who have cheated  as  this type of person is not logically sound.","Some children listen when they are told to not touch the stove, and some children need to be burned first.

 I'm a struggling writer, living in the heart of Appalachia. For the past 3 years, I sent out dozens of short stories. I've had some nice success and even got to share pages with some of my favorite horror writers, real authors like Joe R. Lansdale, Tim Waggoner, and Steve Vernon. 
 But at the rates publishers pay, I would have to publish ten stories a month just to live on the poverty line. I have a wife and four kids and we were never going to get rich on short story money. 
 I had to write something bigger. 
 Up 'til then, I've never written anything over 7K words and the idea of trying to write a 60K word novel just seemed unreachable. I figured that I could try a novella, something around 12K words. Use it as a bridge to writing longer stories. 
 Still, I was afraid. 
 What if it sucked? What if no one read it? What if I couldn't even finish it? 
 The questions started to paralyze me and after a while, I wasn't writing anything. 
 I remembered my previous semester at my local university (yeah, I'm an older student) and the research paper I had done on sigil magic. Sigil magic, if you didn't know, is a mystical means of transcribing a desire into a symbol and using concentration to achieve one's goals. 
 I'm not one into hokey religions, or ancient weapons, but I did understand that sometimes the subconscious needs a push. Dumbo with a magic feather, if you will. 
 I started to wonder if I could create a magic ritual powerful enough to over come my fears. 
 As a writer, I love research. It's like being an archeologist in a way. You sift through pages of material and there, hidden between the lines is inspiration. A golden relic that seems to have waited a millennium for you to find it. I read over dozens of articles on gods, muses, and spirits, but the treasure I discovered was Beleth. 
 Beleth is the southern King of Hell. He commands eighty-five legions of demons and is known to be announced by music. According to legend, he also helped write one of the first books after the flood of Noah. 
 I read that he was particularity hard to summon and would challenge a magician’s bravery before adding them. Challenging fear? Music? Devils? This sounded just like the story I wanted to write! 
 The more I thought about it, the more Beleth seemed like the answer to my prayers. After a few weeks of thinking it over, I came onto reddit (where else) to get some insight from the fine folks at r/occult. They had lots of advice, but mostly, I was warned against it. 
 Too bad I had already made up my mind. 
 I prepared the items I would need and slipped them into a courier bag with a shoulder strap – magic wand made from witch hazel, my laptop, a few candles, a small flashlight, a bag of cherry flavored candies, a joint rolled in a page of Revelations, and a small pocket radio. 
The internet had said that Beleth was strongest at the end of May, so I waited until the 24th and the full moon. I left home around 10:30 and drove to a historical nature trail near my house. 
 I sat in the car for a few minutes, trying to think. Fear crowded my mind from every angle. What if somebody found me? What if I get hurt and can't make it out of the woods? What if I drop my laptop? 
 And the most frightening... What if it works? What if my soul is in jeopardy? 
 I thought about going home, saying that I had done it. More fear. 
 Finally, I got out of the car and grabbed the bag from the trunk. I flipped on the radio and hung it from my belt. Not so much to listen to, but more for scaring off any bears I might happen by in the woods. 
 The radio played some 40's big band standard, pleasant, but also familiar somehow. My mind reminded me of the final scene in Mickey Rourke's Angel Heart. As the radio played, I swung the bag over my shoulder so that the strap hung across my middle and clicked on my flashlight. 
 Just above the mountain ridges behind me was the moon,  deep red and bloated as it began it's decent below the tree tops. I walked away from it, entering the 200 yard field that leads into the forests. Rain had made the ground soggy and rutted. 
 I pressed ahead, my heart hammering in my chest as I tripped and slid over the trail. I tried not to think about snakes. 
 Once I reached the woods, I was covered in sweat. The moon had vanished behind me and the temperature began to fall. The radio lost its signal, so I turned up the static, hoping it would detour any critters from wanting to eat me. 
 I looked back once, but rallied my courage and stepped into the woods. 
 The path way was clear, but all around me grew thick oaks, creeper vine, and thorn bushes. I moved ahead carefully, the flight's beam bouncing in front of me. Following the path, I heard branches snapping on my left and swung the light in that direction. 
 Nothing. I moved ahead. 
 My heart thundered as I proceeded down the trail. The static might have been keeping the beasts away, but it also kept me from hearing anything. If I heard a broken stick, a footstep, or a voice, I couldn't be sure where it was coming from. After about a hundred yards, I found a clear level spot in the path and unslung my bag. 
 I laid out my Ultraman hoodie and knelt on it as I unpacked the supplies. I set up the laptop first, setting the screen to an image of the sigil of Beleth. The light helped as I laid my remaining items by the keyboard. 
 Next, I hung the radio from the branch of an elm tree, carefully turning the dial until music appeared. Thrash metal blared out into the forest, not likely a local station, but I was glad to have the uncomfortable static gone. 
 The song ended quick enough and the DJ came on for station identification as I lit up the candles and placed them around the computer. I tried to relax, taking deep breaths, but my heart continued to rattle in my chest. 
 The DJ's voice faded out and “Mr. Brownstone” by Guns and Roses came on. 
 Maybe it was time for a toke? 
 Solemnly, I lit the joint and inhaled deeply. Around me the forest stood dark and silent. I let the smoke pour out of my lungs, gathering like a mist in the glow of the laptop's screen. I smoked the J down to a stub and laid the roach on on the keyboard. 
 I tried to calm down, but anxiety washed over me from every front. Fear, doubt, and cowardice waft around me like buzzing mosquitoes. 
 With Axle Rose shouting besides me, I took a deep breath and held up the wand I had crafted. 
 I won't tell you what I said, or promised, but I made Beleth a deal. Once the invocation was complete, I swung the wand through the air in three triangle shapes, forcing Beleth into the laptop. 
 Placing the flashlight in my pocket, I stood up and closed my eyes. An image came to me. One that I didn't even tell my wife about. It was more skull than face, mouth open, displaying rows of jagged fangs. On it's head was a golden crown with 13 points, each as rugged as the thing's teeth. It snarled a smile in my mind's eye, pleased with my offer. 
 I opened my eyes. 
 Moths. Moths everywhere. Tiny and white they circled around me, drawn in my the flashlight in my pocket and the glow of the laptop. One of them fluttered in front of me and kissed my lips. 
 At that moment, the radio dropped to static and the laptop's screen saver went to black. 
 I packed up my things quickly, leaving the cherry candies as an offering to Beleth. Slinging the bag cross my chest, I hurried out of the forest. The static continued squawking from the radio until the moment I reached the field, then the radio crackled as the signal reappeared with the opening riffs from Testament’s “Alone in the Dark.” 
 The song played as I crossed the field, stomping through the mud and the weeds in complete darkness. 
 Once I reached my car, my heart started to slow back down. I put my bag in the trunk and slid in behind the wheel. 
 Since then strange things have been happening. I won a writing contest and got to go to a three day writers conference. There I met a couple literary agents, who have since called, asking for manuscripts. An artists on one of my projects had to drop out, only to be replaced by one of the best horror artists in the business. At every turn I seem to find a new writing opportunity. 
 My writing has been coming faster too. I started on my novella and found that it began to expand it to something larger. I was hopping it would be around 12K words. Currently, it's 17K words with probably another 8K to go. 
 I'm not sure what will happen next, but I'm starting to think it's going to be a real surprise.",Invoked a demon to help with my writing. Had a strange experience and now it seems like someone is pulling strings for me.
AskReddit,cgaqd7u,"Not mine, but my wife's first day at a new job. 
 She arrived for her first day at a new job.  While going through the orientations and getting settled in, she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen.  She thought it was just a bad cramp and soldiered on. 
 An hour or so later she felt nauseous and her new boss noticed that she was really pale and asked her if she was OK.  My wife said that she didn't feel well and that her abdomen felt very tender and a bit hard.  Her new boss suggested that she head over to a nearby health clinic which she reluctantly did, not wanting to have a very bad first day at a new job. 
 The clinic couldn't identify what was wrong and scheduled her for an ultrasound the next day at an imaging clinic to see if they could figure out why she was in pain, but suggested that she spend the day resting as it was apparent that she was unwell.  She was advised to head to the emergency room if it got worse. 
 I went home that afternoon to help her out as she was in a lot of discomfort and she rested on the living room couch.  A short while in, she wanted to head to the bathroom.  Helped her up and on the way, she blacked out and collapsed, luckily I was helping her or she would have crashed into the floor. 
 We only lived 2 minutes from the hospital so I managed to get her coherent enough to get her into our vehicle and raced her to emergency.  The triage nurses there took one look at her pallor and admitted her immediately while I provided her health details and waited in the waiting area. 
 About 30 minutes later a nurse came out to get me and brought me in back to be with my wife.  She was hooked up to an IV and all the normal monitors and some of her colour had returned to her face.  As I sat down, my wife took my hand and looked at me and told me that she just found out she was pregnant as they do a pregnancy test on admitted patients with her symptoms. 
 I was surprised and happy, but very cautious as I knew there was 'but' coming.  The 'but' was there was a chance that the pregnancy was related to her current state, and that was worrisome. 
 An ultrasound was immediately scheduled and and the OBGYN on duty came around and asked a bunch of questions and then went away.  The ultrasound was performed (and my wife endured great pain during the procedure) and the OBGYN looked at the results and had mostly concluded that my wife was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, but would need to see how it was progressing to make a full determination.  So, more waiting in the emergency room for us. 
 An hour after finding all of this out, I was sitting quietly with my wife and all of a sudden my wife's skin turned very grey and cool, her eyes grew very big and she grabbed my hand tightly but was shaking.  The monitors started beeping and I yelled for the nurses as it appeared that my wife's condition was rapidly crashing. 
 They came running, did some nursely things and was able to stabilize her to the point her colour started coming back.  A moment later, the OBGYN came in and said that my wife was going to need emergency surgery as it looked like the ectopic pregnancy had ruptured and she was bleeding internally. 
 So, into the ER she is rushed a few minutes later, I got to give her a kiss and said that I would see her after surgery before she disappeared behind the double doors. 
 I had to make a very difficult phone call and telephoned her parents to let them know that their daughter was being rushed into emergency surgery and that they should get on a plane and come out ASAP. 
 3 hours later, she was out of surgery and I was able to see her in her new hospital room.  All wired up and connected to various machines. 
 The doctor came in and described to the both of us that it was in fact an ectopic pregnancy and due to the rupture, was not viable.  My wife had lost A LOT of blood internally and she was very close to having bled out and that we very lucky. 
 I called her new boss first thing the next day to inform her what happened and that the doctor was saying that the recovery time for the surgery was 6 weeks.  My wife wanted to let them know that whatever decision they wanted to make about her employment she would understand. 
 Her new boss (a female) said to take what time she needed and that her job would be waiting for her when she was healthy enough.","Wife starts new job.  On first day, unknown ectopic pregnancy ruptures causing major internal bleeding.  Wife almost dies and is saved by surgery with 6 week recovery.

AskReddit,c9qy2yx,"Hey, man, you're not going to ruin anyone's life. I found out almost five years ago I had herpes and I've dated a few girls and been in two relationships, one that I'm in now. You gotta be confident in yourself. 
 I lucked out and the first girl I dated (who I was engaged to) already knew I had. I'm pretty open about it, several of my friends know about it. Her and I were friends beforehand, so she already knew. I was thrilled because I didn't have to explain myself to her since she already knew. 
 Fast forward almost three years later. Her and I broke up, and I had been online looking. Nothing ever really came of it, though. I started dating this girl. I think I made a rule by the third date I'd tell the person. Reason for this is it gives them enough time to gauge if they're interested or not. So, I get all worked up over this and finally build up the balls to tell her. It's went something like this: 
 Me: Look, I really like you, and I would like to continue to see you. There is something you need to know first. 
 Her: (deer in headlights look) okay... 
 Me: It's not a HUGE deal, but I have herpes. I've been taking medication for it and make sure I check myself regularly. 
 Her: okay. That's fine. 
 Me: ...that's it? 
 Her: yeah, it's not a big deal. 
 Me: Well, that went much better than I expected! 
 Her and I dated for a little while, but nothing was there. The conversation I had with my SO when we first started seeing each other went kind of the same way. Except she ended it with: ""Oh my god I thought you were going to tell me you had a kid or were married or something."" 
 So, don't sweat it. You're not going to ruin any lives. I've been with three people since I've had it and not one of them has caught it. Be confident, take things slow, and you'll be alright. Ever have any questions you can PM me.","I have herpes and all of the girls I've dated didn't care. Oh, be safe and use a condom!!!"

AskReddit,cc2i6es,"Shortly after I moved home from college, I visited the city where I had been to university for BBQ/birthday party for someone in the musical theatre society I had been a part of. 
 I have hypermobile joints but didn't know this at the time. When I arrived at the party I went to sit down and twisted my knee awkwardly. I don't know if you've ever dislocated a major joint, but it hurts like hell. If you've had that joint popped back into place, you'll know that hurts even more. Thanks to my freaky joints, my knee (I think it was the kneecap specifically) did both in the space of a second. It was the kind of pain where you can't even scream, completely knocked me for six. A couple of my friends, including a student nurse, heard the ""pop"" and saw the colour drain from my face. What they suggested, and what I should have done, was take a trip to A&E. But I'd travelled for a party that I'd been looking forward to for weeks, thought ""fuck that!"" threw down a double dose of ibuprofen and asked them to bring me vodka. So I sat there caning spirits and waiting for the painkillers to kick in. This in itself is a stupid combination, please don't do it. 
 Several hours later, everybody is drunk as fuck, me included. I'm still in agony but trying to style it out, I can even hobble enough to get myself between the bathroom and the booze. Life is good. 
 The a friend of mine starts talking about the ludicrously high-energy, intense Morris Dance a few of us had had to learn for the last show we had been in, and wouldn't it be a great idea to do it tonight while we're all liquored-up? OF COURSE! 
 I drag my leg through about half of the routine until a move that involved hopping from one leg to the other. My injury, by this point, would no longer be denied. My leg completely gives way and I hit the deck. Same deal as before, rapid dislocation/relocation on a knee that already hurt like fuck. I'm utterly wasted by this point but even that can't make me shake the feeling that I done fucked up. I'm staying at a friends house that night and don't want to be an inconvenience so in spite of EVERYBODY urging me to go to hospital, I manage to convince them I'll sleep it off. 
 I don't sleep. At all. It hurts to move, it hurts to lie still, it hurts to have a blanket over my leg. By morning my knee has swollen up to the size of a football and I can't move it at all without searing pain. 
 One afternoon in A&E later and I'm in a full-leg splint for the rest of summer. The kicker? The hospital had ""run out"" of crutches that day (lol NHS) so I had to drag my errant limb behind me for months.

[MFW]( I noticed it was not a fart but a turbulent flow of diarrhea. No one noticed but my brother who was besides me and left with me crying of laughter. I really need to say I was about 12yo when I had this ""bad experience"" so I totally depended on transport with my mother. She was one store ahead, and she insisted after seeing me shat through my shorts to finish her last shop.

AskReddit,c9us5xm,"Might be way too late for this thread. A few years back, my parents let my older brother (18 at this point) and I (16?) have a party. We both hung out with the same crowd (my brother's friends) for the most part and invited a small crowd of about a dozen people or so. What everyone has failed to realize is that one of these people (let's call him B) has barely slept for 3 days due to an ecstasy binge. He arrived with 24 beer. 
 Fast forward about 4 hours and B has more than half of his flat gone and is talking nonsense, this is about when I say fuck it and hit bed. So apparently, a while after I went to bed, B proceeds to take a sit-piss on one of the guys that was sleeping on the couch. Another guy apparently tried to scoop his dick up with a trashcan to keep him from pissing everywhere. As they say though... It gets worse. 
 Now, I suppose I should mention that I lived quite far out in the country and no one was volunteering to take this guy home at 2 in the morning, so my brother put him outside on the deck with some blankets and pillows to sober up. A little while later though, my mom wakes up because she hears someone coming in the front door/heading to the bathroom (she didn't know of the events that had already occurred). So she gets about halfway down the hallway and smells shit, BAD. So she looks towards the bathroom where the door is open and there is B, on the edge of the bathtub SHITTING into it; he sees my mom, jumps up (no pants/boxers), pulls his shirt down over his cock and ass without wiping and runs.

Game is over and the guys(my) team is warming, I'm out due to an injury so I all I can do is screw around near the sideline. She's walking towards me with her best friend with what in my opinion was clearly a pained look on her face, I ask her if she's feeling alright, being the type of person she is she tries to tell me that she's fine but it's clear to me that even speaking is causing her more discomfort. So I walk with her for a little ways down the track and I steer her towards the athletic trainer and I say to him ""Hey, Coach BlahBlah, she's really hurt will you but being stubborn will you give her a look over?"".

AskReddit,c4l1fvb,"The action scenes are well done, the humour is well-placed and doesn't seem forced. It's the culmination of several years worth of work on a number of different films, which all have lead up to this one. 
 It's the best representation of the Hulk on the big screen to date, it's actually (apparently) pretty faithful to the source material and every major area it could have slipped up it's pretty much nailed it, at least for those of us who were looking forward to it so could have been disappointed. 
 The group dynamic is also handled quite well, I thought. 
 As for the reasons you didn't like it: 
 
 There is a story behind them all. Actually, quite extensive backstory: 
 
 Captain America, the supersoldier experiment who was frozen in WWII when he crashed an aircraft into the sea (Arctic circle, I believe, but I can't remember exactly), only to be unfrozen in the present day. That's the reason for his disconnect with the modern world. 
 Thor, the Norse god of thunder. In his film, he lost his power and had to redeem himself.  Long story short, his brother, Loki (the bad guy in Avengers) turner out to be an ice giant (bad guy) and when he found this out he tried to seize the throne of Asgard (the home of the Norse gods). Eventually he was vanquished, sent off into space.  The old scientist guy Loki kidnaps/hypnotises at the beginning of Avengers plays a decent-sized role in Thor and is only bad in Avengers because of the hypnosis. 
 Black Widow is a bloody good spy. To be honest, almost all I know about her backstory is explained in The Avengers, with the exception of the fact that she's introduced when she starts working undercover in Stark Industries for Shield. 
 Hawkeye is a bloody good archer. Again, all I know of him is from The Avengers. Seems like a pretty cool guy. 
 
 I believe what they actually tell him is that he can't control when he becomes Hulk, but that's what he's been working on in his self-imposed exile. He's basically saying he can control when he changes. Also, it seems he can control himself when he's Hulk if he controls when he becomes him. It's not one I fully understand, but there's enough room for subtleties that I'm perfectly willing to let it slide because there is a bunch of possible explanations. 
 
 The villain was Loki, the Norse god of tricks. He's not a big fight kinda guy; he tricks people into doing what he wants them to do, and that's how he fights. Villains don't always have to be big and menacing, and I think that Loki's quite a good example of that. That said, I think he seemed out of his depth, which I find interesting because the post-credits scene sets up the people he was helping invade earth as the antagonists of the next one, meaning that maybe the threat will be even bigger next time. 
 
 I just disagree on this point. I'm not sure what I can do to convince you, but I thought it was very well-handled. Then again, it was pretty much what I'd hoped for, and if you'd wanted something different then your experience will have been soured. 
 
 Well, that's no reason to dislike it. That said, I do that about things as well. I'd genuinely recommend watching Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America and then trying Avengers again, but that's just because I enjoyed them all.",I enjoyed Avengers. It did what I wanted it to do and more.

 ""She'll go home when the buses run again."" He said. 
 I went to the bedroom and cried for a bit. Then I called my mother and told her I was moving back home.

AskReddit,c7c7t7o,"I couldn't climb the peach tree so I climbed a bigger one in our front yard.  Success!  Well, afterwards I wanted to sit in the tree and pretend everything the light touched was part of my kingdom.  But the tree branch was extremely uncomfortable.  So my 10 yr old brain got a brilliant idea!  A LAWN CHAIR!  While embarrassing I do want to point out that I hauled a LAWN CHAIR up a tree about fifteen feet, maybe more?  Sigh... Anyways I set the chair on the branch... and sit in the chair.  ""Ahh, everything the li-"" and boom, I'm falling.  I fall ON the chair and we had grass ALL OVER and one strip of sidewalk leading to the door.  I somehow landed on the sidewalk too.  Broke my wrist. 
 So now, my mom makes it a point to tell everyone.  One time I visited her at work during a training class.  I stroll in and everyone asks,""Is this your son!?""  I proudly take credit.  They laugh.

 I was working as a paramedic in a large southern city. This city is very violent - I was issued a bulletproof vest when I started working there. 
 I was on scene for a shooting - a teenage male had been shot in the head. The fire department was doing CPR, my partner was preparing to start an IV, and I was preparing to insert a breathing tube into the young man's lungs. 
 The scene was supposedly ""secure"" - PD was on scene, but the scene was absolute chaos. 
 I heard someone scream ""He's got a gun!"" I looked up and to my left to see someone running towards me, pointing a gun at me. 
 I'll never forget this - when I saw the man with the gun, my vision tunneled, color changed to black and white, everything began to move in slow motion, and there was no sound. 
 As the man ran closer to me, I could see he was looking right at me. I just remember thinking to myself, ""Shit, I'm dead. He's going to shoot me right in the side and I have no protection from my vest. He's going to shoot me through my heart and my lungs, and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm fucking dead."" I remember thinking this to myself in a very ""matter of fact"" way. 
 The next thing I know, the gunman looks past me, over my left shoulder. The look on his face changes from ""I'm going kill you"" to ""Oh, shit!"" 
 He turns 90 degrees to his left and continues to run, but now, he's running away from me. I see three people run from my left to my right - turns out they were police officers running after the gunman. The gunman is running so fast that he's starting to overstep himself. He eventually trips and falls, losing his gun in the process. As he falls, the police dog pile him. I saw the gun hit the sidewalk, making a ""clack"" sound as it hit. It bounced off of the sidewalk a few more times, finally skidding to a stop in the street - ""clackclackclackskiiiiiiiiiiid."" The gun hitting the sidewalk and street was the only sound I had heard so far. 
 As I'm staring at the gun I could hear someone asking, ""Bigbabysurfer, what do you want to do now?"" The voice grew louder - ""Bigbabysurfer, what do you want to do now?"" 
 All of a sudden I was back to reality - it was my partner asking me what I wanted to do. I kept looking between the patient and the gunman, and decided to continue working the patient. 
 The patient survived the shooting, but sustained significant brain damage - his parents elected for him to be an organ donor. Strangely enough, I have no idea what happened to the gunman - this happened 15 years ago.",working as a paramedic trying to save a shooting victim; almost got shot myself
AskReddit,c3baxsa,"Rejection isn't even that bad though! That's the part I never got, my friends are always worried about talking with a girl for fear of rejection but to me the math is quite simple. Maybe you think that you don't have the best chances with some guy - okay, fine - but you have zero chances if you don't ask. 
 I think the biggest thing that's overlooked on Reddit with all the ""friendzone"" crap and all the flirting tips is that confidence is what people are attracted to. 
 Why do girls swoon to a guy with a guitar? Because everybody can hear him play and he better damn well be confident enough to play well enough for everyone to hear. Why do guys all swoon to the bitchy vixen when there's a bunch of perfectly cute wallflowers at the party? Because she knows she looks good and is bitchy about it. Deep down inside we know they have to have a reason or purpose to be that confident and that makes them a great ""potential mate"". 
 I've kinda ranted about this because it kills me to see anyone scared to talk to others. At a party people are lonely and literally more than half are for the taking if you just ask. The rest are already preoccupied with someone who already asked.

AskReddit,c3i2r8x,"This will probably get buried since it's so long, but here goes. 
 Myspace was still pretty big when I was a senior in high school. A couple of douchey bully-type kids had gotten into trouble a couple of months earlier for making a fake Myspace account posing as one of the history teachers, ""Mr. H"". Mr. H would pretty regularly creep on the attractive girls in his classes (assign their seats closer to his, make cutesy jokes, etc.) but everyone knew he was pretty harmless. Anyways, these guys made an account posing as him and would post some pretty raunchy comments on girls' photos (""That swim-suit is hot.. see me after class"" or ""Damn girl those tits look sweet"", stuff to that effect). He caught on to it after a while, got SUPER pissed, and went to the school resource officer (police officer assigned to security detail basically). Not sure how they ended up getting caught, but they were in some pretty serious trouble. Almost got expelled, ended up getting suspended for a couple of weeks. 
 Once the resource officer started looking around, she figured out that she could get people into trouble for their myspace stuff. Several people got suspended over the course of the next month or two for having pictures of underage drinking, smoking weed, etc. 
 So I'm sitting at my house with my buddy, stoned as shit, and we get the bright idea to pull a similar prank on the resource officer. We add funny stuff to the info section, make the profile picture a pig with a cop badge painted on the side, and get to work trolling our friends' pages and pictures. She found out about it a couple of weeks later, and needless to say was not happy. She got the state law-enforcement office involved, and had them track down the IP address used to create the account. After some detective work, my name and house obviously came up. 
 She sat my buddy and I down (how she found out he was involved I have NO fucking idea, as I didn't rat him out), and layed into us. She threatened to press charges for felony-level impersonation of a police officer, have us expelled, etc.. it turned out she was just trying to scare us and admit we were stupid, but we both ended up getting suspended for a couple of weeks. 
 When I finally came back to school after two fun-filled weeks of rebellion, I found out that during the first week of my suspension they had drug dogs sweep the school parking lots, and a bunch of people got in trouble. I definitely would have been one of those people, because as a high schooler with no real safe place to smoke weed, I'd just ride around in my car with my buddies. I've never been so happy that I got in trouble in my life. Also, while we were gone people had started to spread our story, and when we came back we were heroes for standing up to the resource officer's gestapo-like internet police bullshit.","Fake myspace account pretending to be school cop, got suspended and didn't have drug dogs find the stash in my car."

AskReddit,c0f0yy0,"Actually, unfortunately for most people on here, it  is  our fault when the attention of a female wanders.  It is usually being too needy.  When she pulls away, you shove in and try to prove your love even more. However, this is exactly opposite the correct solution.  Pull away first, give yourself distance, and let her remember why she wants to spend time with you. 
 If she thinks you are a sexy mofo, she won't cheat.  Your relationship will be 1000x healthier.  Trust me, this shit really works.  Humans are animals, and animal sexual behavior does follow rules.

AskReddit,cdbgbex,"A few weeks ago, I went to visit my friend who went away to college for their homecoming weekend. My buddy, who we'll call Thad drove with me and we made it on Friday night, went out and passed out. 
 The next day, we didn't have enough booze to get shitfaced (we were all under 21) we had to make ""homemade Jaegerbombs"" out of pre-workout and rum, which were fucking terrible. We still weren't drunk enough after the game so my friend James and his girlfriend came up with a bottle of ""death mix"" which was everclear, fireball, and like three other kinds of alcohol in a fireball handle. We pre-gamed and wen out to this one house for a party when a friend I haven't seen in a while calls me up to pre-game so Thad and I leave for his house. We do a few Jaegerbombs, shotgun a few beers and take some other shots and go out. We all get separated and at around 2-3 in the morning, parties are getting broken up and cops are starting to corral/stop people. I call James and he informs me that Thad was too shitfaced an that him and his gf were taking him back to my buddy's dorm. I told him I'd make my way back there when he tells me that my buddy's roommate got an MIP and that I should wait a bit. 
 I call my sister since her boyfriend lived on campus and I knew where his apartment was to see if he could let me crash there. She tells me that since he's at work, she'll call his roommate to unlock the door. So I go to his apartment, open the door and there's a pillow and blanket on the couch. I raid the fridge for a few slices of pizza and a beer and pass out. 
 Only it wasn't her boyfriend's apartment... 
 I wake up to some dude violently shaking me and yelling (Caps are the other guy)

  ""DUDE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU IN MY FUCKING HOUSE !?""
 ""This is a joke right?""
""NO, DUDE I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE, WHY ARE YOU HERE?""
""This isn't Tom's apartment?""
""WHO THE FUCK IS TOM?!?!"" 
 So I jump up and start freaking out and telling him what happened and beg him not to call the cops or kick my ass and he calms down. He looks out the window and looks back at me. ""You're under 21?"" I nod. ""Alright, here's the deal. I've had a few tonight so I can't drive, and I'd feel bad if you got an MIP or got hurt so you can crash here for the night.""

He's like ""yeah, sure, just if you need to puke make sure you do it in the bathroom."" So I pass out to him watching Ninja Turtles and wake up to him making eggs. I thank him profusely and offer him money and he declines. After that he offers me breakfast but I couldn't because I had plans with my friends.

 I knew a kid in highschool, we'll call him John. You could say he was my ""friend"", but the kind of friend who you only remain ""friends"" with to stay on there good side. He was the type of person that was such a jerk that even if he had nobody on his side to back him up, no matter who he was up against, he would still fight to the death to make you miserable. Because of this, most people were in the same boat as me, being his ""friends"" to keep out of trouble. Anyways, in 11th grade, I had a small engines class with him. Right away he started picking on the 10th graders in the class, one particularly small kid decided to fight back. for several weeks they fought, and soon nobody would talk to the kid for fear of getting on John's bad side. Around then, a new kid who had just moved here joined the class, of course he didn't know what was going on, and made friends with Johns enemy. Needless to say John wasn't happy with him now either. The only problem was this new kid was smart, and pretty strong also. So when they fought (verbally and physically) the new kid could almost always humiliate John. After several weeks of this, John was fed up, and came up with a plan (which was a big deal for him, since he wasn't very smart). The reason this new guy had moved here was because his mom did meth and cheated on his dad for money (to buy meth of course), they got divorced, and he moved here with his dad. Well John found out this guys mom only lived about 10 miles away in a nearby City. From what I heard (John of course bragged, so everyone knew the story to everyone) he found her number and called her saying he could hook her up with some more meth in exchange for her ""services"". It worked, and he followed through. One day I came to class and everybody was huddled around him in the back, he had taken video of him and this guys mom ""doing it"". When the new guy got there John immediately began harassing him. After all the new kid had been through with the divorce and shit, he snapped and began kicking Johns ass. The teacher came in a couple of minuets into the fight and brought both of them to the principals office. They were both then suspended. I found out later that he was more pissed because his mom was awaiting trial for drug charges, and since she used again things would be much worse off for her, then he was about the sex. Still, it literally ruined his already pretty crummy life. It was one of the saddest things I ever witnessed. Luckily (sort of) John was stupid enough to record everything, including him giving the meth to her, so he was charged for possession and transfer of drugs (or something like that), and later expelled. It didn't help the new guy though, he moved again soon after this, but I heard (but cant confirm) he was caught trying to kill himself.

AskReddit,c51g2t0,"Late to the party, so it'll probably be buried, but it seems reddit has finally given a thread I am qualified to comment on! I'm a med student, with a psychology degree and I'm from one of the countries you speak of, The Netherlands. 
 The debate has been at its highest since years because there were a few new stories and some of them were controversial.  I'll try to briefly explain why I DO NOT agree a mental illness is the same as a physical illness. 
First things first: you raise three different points. 1) If people want to commit suicide, they should be free to do so, it's their own choice 2) People with a chronic illness should be able to receive assistance from a health care professional in committing suicide 3) chronic mental pain should be treated in the same way a chronic physical pain is treated. 
 1)  I agree with this. Nothing to add. People should do whatever they want. As long as they don't hurt others, it's fine. Of course when someone commits suicide, there is almost always someone who will be hurt, emotionally, but let's draw the line at physical hurt, because otherwise we're going off in a total different direction of debate. 
 2)  This is a tough one. As I said, I'm in med school and there's a good chance in the future a patient with a chronic ailment might request help committing suicide, or assisting him in death. A doctor's role is difficult in this sense that on the one hand is trained to cure and prolong life. On the other hand, it is your duty to reduce suffering. What good is it to live the last 3-4 months with late stage cancer, writing in pain and not even being able to go outside or enjoy life at all? In my short time as an internet, I've already seen too many 90+ year olds with almost no quality of life being pumped full with every medication known to man and receive a ton of operations, to become 91. It's ridiculous. That is suffering, and a physician might feel it is best to alleviate the suffering by assisting the patient in suicide. It's a completely valid point. There are a significant amount of physicians who think the burden should not be theirs to carry though. They feel they were trained to help people, cure them, reduce suffering, but not assist them in suicide. That too is a completely valid point. In my opinion each case should be viewed and reviewed individually. The requirements should always be A) the patient is clearly suffering B) the suffering is chronic and can only be ended by death C) the patient is making a VOLUNTARY decision to do this. He or she should be ""sane"". This is a VERY important notion for point 3. 
 3)  Should mental illnesses be treated in the same way as physical illnesses? The answer is a definite and resounding no. A mental illness is not at all the same as a physical illness. That is NOT saying a mental illness can't be horrible. People who suffer from major depression go through hell, every, single, day. The important part here is that these people cannot be considered ""sane"" in a strict sense of the word. In Dutch the word is ""toerekeningsvatbaar"". It translates to something like ""being able to be held accountable for one's actions"". You can attribute a person's actions to THEM it means. This is often NOT the case when dealing with mental illnesses. 
 A mental illness is a disease of the mind. The mind and reason is clouded. I'm not saying depressed people are lunatics, but they aren't sane in the clinical sense of the word. So when they sign a consent form saying they want to be assisted in suicide, you CANNOT say it is THEM, their person, signing the form, for sure. That is the problem with a mental illness and assisted suicide. The notion of a sane person, voluntarily signing his own death is not always the case and this is unethical. 
 A last example that will speak more to you, as I assume not many can imagine what it's like to be depressed (I studies psychology for 5 years and still can't):
Alzheimer's disease. This is a real case (a bit shortened): a woman diagnosed with Alzheimer's says she wants to die because she doesn't want to live not being able to perform any serious cognitive ability, and to be a burden to her family. The doctor agrees, forms are signed and wills are taken care of. She was only recently diagnosed though, so right now her symptoms are not severe. She says she wants to die when she can't recognize her children anymore. 
 This is fine, but she suddenly gets a lot worse, in a very short time span. They are on holiday for a month or so, the physician is too, and suddenly they are 'too late'. She has clear moments and not so clear ones. She has trouble recognizing her own doctor (the one who will assist her in suicide) and when asked if she wants to die, she can't give a clear answer. She is not 'sane' (remember, this word isn't exactly the same as people use it in a daily sense). She is clearly confused and the doctor still agrees that she is suffering. He sees her cry and she is clearly distressed. He decides to go through with the procedure and they go upstairs. Even though she can't give a clear ""yes i want to die because I have Alzheimer's disease"". They have to inject her with a sedative first, because she is struggling and pacicking...

 So that's one example, the paradox of Alzheimer's disease. When you are sane, you are not suffering. When you are suffering, you are not sane. There are many more, but you've already read a small chapter so I'll let you go. This is why I think mental illnesses are not the same as physical illnesses. Because they affect and cloud the mind, thus people are not sane and cannot make this decision.

AskReddit,cga79em,"This one time at Denny's (here we go) I (19m at the time) was hanging out with a bunch of friends from a party (obviously drunk and having way too much fun.) There were about 6 of us so we took a corner booth. To the left of us there was a string of half-booth tables and some 23ish year olds were sitting there. I was that kind of drunk where you could fall asleep if you were to lay down. 
 I glanced over to the girls, smiling at them and flicked my head at them. I was just being friendly. 
 I went on with my time at Denny's laughing, being drunk and whatnot when I noticed one of my friends staring at me, wide-eyed, like ""DUDE WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING"" and I responded with drunken confusion. I hear from an unknown source ""apparently not"" and then this shape shuffles away. Eventually we left, and we went back to partying and stuff until the morning. 
 I got home, showered and tried to recap my night. I then realized I could've totally tried to meet a nice girl. I was like ""AUUUUUUUUUGH WHY"" and it made a really good story to talk about with my friends who were there for it. Honestly I think I would've just made an ass of myself, but still.

AskReddit,cbqb0pv,"I worked at Best Buy for about 8 months. I worked back in the computer department as a Sales Associate. Working with 4 other guys, all of whom were black, (I was the only white guy) I heard my fair share of racist comments from customers. 
 The only one that stuck out in my mind was on a Saturday, our busiest days.  Everyone was stacked with at least 2 customers, helping them choose laptops, get monitors, etc. My coworker was helping out a white guy who was looking at the touch screen laptops. Another person, who was black, walked up behind my friend and interrupted him, asking him where to find something. Coworker turned to tell the new guy, ""Let me finish helping this guy, and then I'll get right to you sir."" 
 But the White guy thought my coworker was leaving him to help the new Black guy. He began shouting ""Are you fucking kidding me? You're just going to fucking ignore me like that? Sure just give your 'brotha' special treatment"" He then just starts shouting a shit ton of racial slurs and cursing everything, demanding a manager. The face my friend made was just pure confusion at the situation. 
 I'm watching from the sidelines and dying from laughter. I call my coworker back over to me and go to try and calm down the guy while my managers were coming over. He kept shouting about how racist my friend was being, while, at the same time, yelling about how my coworker ""only helps niggers"". I was trying so hard to not laugh while I offered to help him with his computer problems. 
 The managers arrive. They proceed to speak to the man involved and my coworker. Then when the enraged man kicked over a display of headphones, they kicked him out.","A white guy called my black coworker a ""Racist"" for ""only helping out niggers""."

And then I woke up and got really scared (don't know why) and started seeing things and my stuffed animals looked really menacing, so I called for my mom but when she came in, I couldn't see her clearly and her face looked deformed.

AskReddit,c63lq1n,"When I was going through my job training in the Marine Corps I met a dude who, at the time, was pretty ""locked-on"" as they say. He always had his room squared away, his uniform was always immaculate and he was physically fit. He seemed normal enough when we were off base. I wasn't close friends with him, but we got on alright. He finished MOS school and was sent to Camp Pendleton; I showed 2-3 months later. Now, as a boot (FNG, etc.) you can expect some pretty shit treatment until you earn your keep. Since our unit was pretty small and required us to be unsupervised most of the time, the shit treatment usually didn't last too long. But this kid, this kid was treated like every day was his first day. Apparently he had gotten himself into some trouble, and then some more, and then drank too much, and then didn't always show up to work, or formations, or really do anything. He turned into an asshole and a burden on everyone in the shop. Everyone caught shit for him fucking up, and our workload increased as we had to pick up his slack. To top it off, they made him my roommate so that I could watch out for him and keep him clean. I had just turned 21, had spending money for the first time in my life and was living in Southern California - in sum, fuck that. 
 Anyway, he got stuck ordering supplies and doing paperwork for our unit and then got drunk and passed out in the room while I was out working. Finally, one night I came home from a full day or sweating my nuts off and he is passed the fuck out (par for the course). I go to toss some stuff in the trash and see there is no bag, so I pull some papers out and realize he had been forging paperwork to order a ton of shit from supply for himself. It was the first time we had hard evidence to hold up against this kid (for some reason the higher-ups thought he was still a great kid because he was extremely polite and well-dressed). I turn it in the next morning, and end up being out of the office all day. I come back and find out this kid found out I turned him in, sent me a death threat and then ran away so nobody knew where he was. I go back to my room, bullshit around for a bit (waiting for my murderous roommate, fuck me right) and decide he's gone for good. I go out in town to grab some food, come home and find the door open. I go in, and sure enough there's a shank (piece of wood shaped like a stake, grips and all; because I'm a vampire) sitting on the sink. Luckily, I was out of the room when he came for me and he left to go booze it up some more. Got it reported - he went to the brig - got out - did some other shit - got kicked out.","Roommate/co-worker was a piece of shit, stole hundreds of dollars of gear/funds from our shop and, were it not for poor timing, would have shanked me."
AskReddit,c29mgqs,"The Government has no control over what companies do as long as they dont break the law (corporations or any other type of company). 
 You might say then, 'why doesnt the government make it illegal to outsource jobs?'  and my answer to that is it would never hold up in court. 
 What the government  can  do is create an environment that is 'business friendly' by lowering taxes on domestic companies, factories, offices and the like.  Taxing foreign goods (aka tarriffs) to ensure that domestically produced goods can compete with goods from countries that have cheap labor costs (china).  The downside is that this makes everything more expensive, and that is  extremely  unpopular, so much so that treaties like NAFTA get through the senate with ease.","jobs get shipped overseas because WE let it happen because WE were not willing to pay more for american products.

AskReddit,c5dm0fp,"Okay, here's what it's actually like being a young and ugly female. 
 I can sum it up in one word: Invisible. I'm not terribly outgoing but I'm not shy either. I have confidence when I need it and I try to make friends and be a likeable person. But most of the time it doesn't matter. I am invisible. I'm trying not to generalize guys, because I have certainly met some wonderful guys who treat me nicely. But the majority of guys, especially attractive ones, literally don't even notice I'm there. 
 It's much much worse if I go out with friends who are attractive. I will be standing right in front of someone, and they are so zeroed in on my pretty friend that they don't know I'm standing there. Don't get me wrong, I don't need to be showered in attention, but it's incredibly frustrating when, after twenty mintutes of simply being left out of a conversation, a guy turns to me and says, ""Oh! I didn't see you there."" Cue me, giving him the ""are you fucking kidding me"" look. I've been there the whole time, trying to join the conversation. 
 It's also frustating when employers give the job to a less qualified but better looking woman. Or job advertisements for jobs that are sort of at the front door, so to speak and they say ""we are looking for someone with a clean professional look."" Just say that you want attractive people, okay? We get it. 
 One final thing that frustrates me to no end is when guys who are kind of average or a bit ugly are holding out for the hot girls. Do they seriously think they're going to get a Scarlet Johanson? What is this?","Being an ugly female sucks balls (but not literally, cause guys want pretty girls)."
AskReddit,cbz8t7n,"I moved in with my buddy (call him J) after his wife split and it was a pretty cool situation.  The one thing I didn't like was that this bitch (call her A) lived right behind us and would often come over to smoke pot.

Well fuck you very much I thought and proceeded to be Ice to her from that point on whenever she came over to hang out with us.  There was no love between us at all.

I prayed she would get cancer or her house would burn down, seriously FUCK her! 
 One night chillaxing at home by myself  like a baller I wanted to bust out the bong and play mario kart wii.  Mario Kart wii and weed had been the social glue that let us all hang out so much, so I texted A asking if she wanted to burn and play.  I asked her mostly out of loneliness and I knew she would be down despite hating eachother like lions and hyenas.  A is down and we start smoking and racing.  This shit is going back and forth, we are not competing to win, we are racing so the other person loses. 
 In anger A throws her controller on the couch, and sits there with a grumpy look on her face.  OH! did I mention A despite being queen of the cunts was EXACTLY my type and hotter then hell? Because thats pretty important when factoring into what happened next. 
 After throwing down her controller and taking a huge bong hit I ask hers whats up.  She says ""I'm frustrated...I'm horny lol""   I can't believe this bitch thinks I'm going to fuck her (start kissing), she is such a bitch(tearing clothes off), if she thinks I'm going to do this (Raw, hard thrusting and screaming) she is out of her damn mind(panting and sweating).

We rarely got to see each other, but I still loved him first semester. I went home for wired break, and it was clear we were becoming different people. I was adjusting to college and making many friends. He was having a harder time and got extremely clingy. That, coupled with family problems at home, made him rely on me as his sole form of social interaction. I stayed with him second semester even though it became increasingly clear that I couldn't be with him for much longer. By the end, I was barely talking to him and resented him.

 But then, we did something that most 13 year old's don't do: we did something about it. We formed a charity, and appealed to the local council, the Lottery, and pretty much any group providing funds for the £60,000 needed to build a skatepark. One of the prerequisites of them even considering us for funding was that we needed to raise several thousands ourselves first. Being the Fundraising Co-ordinator, it was my job to organise this and handle the money afterwards. Well, we worked our butts off, and within a few months, we had raised about £3,500. 
 Eventually, after dealing with far more agencies than I even new existed at that age (RoSPA, Insurance etc), we raised the funds. Our own skatepark was actually built! It still stands there today. 
 To this day, it's one of the things I'm most proud of. Most kids that age would complain about lack of facilities, blame ""the man"", and do nothing expecting someone in authority to somehow read their tiny minds.

 So I was out one night trying with this girl I liked for a while and her friend Douche invited us to a party at Creep's house. I had been fooling around with this girl all summer and thought it might go somewhere that night. Creep turned out to be an older guy in his early to mid 50s. We were 18(me) and 17(her) at the time. Douche was 21 or 22. 
 Creep's house was empty, way too empty for a ""party"", but we were really early so I thought nothing of it. The interior of the guy's house was really weird. It had a dingy-mountain-man-come-wild-west thing going on(complete with antlers). Which was weird because we were in the suburbs of a metropolitan city. Apparently the guy was the outdoorsy type. 
 It gets to be around 9pm and 2 more girls show up, who were invited by Douche. Both of the girls were 19 or 18 at the time and unhappy about the situation. 
 Creep's niece, in her early 40s also shows up, and has her eye on me the whole time. Suffice to say she was much larger than me(5'8 145lbs), and took up one and a half seats on the couch. 
 The new girls start getting bored and the girl I'm with keeps telling me not to be rude and to talk to the niece. I could not figure out why, considering I had actually spoken to the woman and was clearly uncomfortable with her advances. 
 After repeated attempts from the girl to force me to engage the woman in conversation, I relented and sat next to her. Then it gets wierd. 
 She put her rather heavy leg across my lap as if to shield other predators from her catch. I could not move without being rude and I was frankly a bit scared about what was going on. 
 After about 10 mins of her grabbing and trying to tickle me, Creep comes over and says, ""Lady...Lady don't do this again."" I looked at her innocently and asked myself why he would say that of all things. Then he says, ""if you want to do it, it's up to you Lady...I'm not gonna say nothin."" 
 Fast forward a bit, and the girl I liked is actually enjoying watching me squirm in this extremely awkward situation and I was pissed at her for not doing anything about this. Douche is just laughing his fucking ass off. The two girls are kind of grossed out by what Lady was doing and decide they want to leave. I gave them a look of plea, my eyes begged for them to pull me out of this. They left me there and went home. 
 **Reader Discretion is advised. 
 Then, Lady says she wants to show me something by the side of the house and grabs my by the hand. She takes me to the side of the house and starts unbuttoning my pants. I said, ""Hey Creep and everybody are right over there, what are you doing?!"" She pulls out my cock and starts sucking with the force of Almighty Zeus. I felt like she was going to rip my dick off with just sheer suction capacity. Robert Oreck would have been proud. 
 She had clearly been in this situation before and proceeds to try to tougue-fuck my ass from between my legs and licks my gooch(that are between your ball sack and your asshole). 
 I'm sure she thought she was turning me on but it was extremely painful, after a while and my dick being in too much pain to come and even going flaccid from the abuse, she stops and says lets go back in. 
 We get back and everyone is gone, the house is fucking EMPTY. All the lights are off or dim. 
 Lady says, ""You can just stay, I'll drop you in the morning."" But I was freaked out. I had no idea how to get out of here and because I went to a school really far away, I had no friends who were close by that could take me home. 
 I figured ok, I'll just watch a movie and try to sleep...but Lady had a different plan. While I'm on the couch, she comes sits next to me and grabs my cock again. Pulls my pants all the way down and lifts her dress to reveal the largest naked ass I have ever seen in real life to this day. Her thighs were like ""two big Christmas hams""...seriously I was scared...because I knew...I knew I was about die...by Snoo-Snoo 
 ...and I was scared. 
 My thighs and hips hurt in the morning...my cock was dealing with PTSD... 
 For all of you who might say I got man-raped...my problem is that I don't know how to let people know when I disapprove of something. I'm too nice to hurt someone's feelings...plus somewhere deep in the chasms of my subconscious...I wanted to see what would happen. 
 What about everyone else? Turns out Lady had seen my pic on-line through Douche's Facebook and wanted my nuts ever since. Douche on the other hand was jealous of the me because the girl and myself were kinda hitting it off all summer and tells the girl that I am only interested in getting laid. So, Lady and Douche coordinated this whole thing so that Douche could take off with my girl and Lady could have her way. To top it off, when Lady was messing with me on the couch and I did not stop her scary advances, Douche used this to as a proof of his theory to my girl. 
 Finally, when Lady took me to the side of the house, the girl apparently knew in advance what was about to happen and was pissed that I did not stop it...AND WHY THE FUCK DID SHE KEEP FORCING ME TO TALK TO HER? A fucking test. She wanted to test me to see if I'm just looking for sex.","Girl takes me to ""party"" at moutain man's house, turns out, his middle-aged niece wanted to have her way with me.

AskReddit,c5pcy9f,"When I was in high school, there was a computer basics class that I was in. There was a digital camera stationed in the classroom that we were allowed to use for educational purposes. I sat behind a girl who's whale-tail would hang out every day. 
 The school also had a laptop program where we all we given our own PCs. Along with the laptops came the school wide email. We would usually abuse the email system as an instant messenger of sorts because the school blocked MSN, AIM, etc. 
 I'm 15 years old at the time and filled with hormones, you know the story. I would take pictures of this girl's thong each day and email them to my friends. 
 A month or so later I'm called down to the office for questioning. The girls father was the school police officer and somehow found out about what I had been up to. Oddly enough, the girl still had no idea that I had done anything I was accused of. 
 I ended up getting slapped with sexual harassment (through the school), suspended for 3 days, computer taken away for 5 days, and had my hard drive erased.","Got busted for sending pictures of a classmates whale-tail to friends over the school's email system.

Now, a normal person would knock on the door or text/call or even just wait till the next time they saw me. This was not the case. Instead, this girl opens the door to my room, and stands over me rubbing the quarters in my ear until I wake up. I open my eyes and scream because this girl is 2 pointed ears short of a gremlin.

AskReddit,c5ut218,"This prob. won't be read by many but here's mine. Back in the day when I was 20, (I'm in my 30's now) a couple friends and myself were drinking. Well somehow the 3 of us ended up on Craigslist browsing the escort section. I think it was the thrill of seeing pics of women we could actually sleep with given we had the cash. As it turns out, this night, we did. So there's me, my buddy lets say David, and my other friend we'll call Scott. David and myself are best friends and Scott is just someone we see from time to time but is a cool guy none the less. Well David and myself decide to come up with a plan to get Scott laid. He had girlfriends and everything, we just picked him for some reason. So the plan was to tell Scott that the escort was for me, then at the last min. tell him she was really for him. So the call is made, a deal is stuck, address is given, and now we wait. Now I'm sure this is not a surprise to most of you, but to us we thought we would be getting exactly what the girl in the picture looked like. We did not, or should I say, Scott did not. So she come inside and says, ""so who's it gonna be?"". David and myself point to Scott at the same time Scott points at me. I remember Scott not really saying too much and just kinda going with it. So they go in the guest room. It was Davids idea to use the guest room because the closet is attached to the hot water heater room. So there's no back to the closet in the guest room. So...Scott goes in the guest room with the escort and David and myself go into the hot water heater room so we can listen/watch kinda. The parts I remember seeing after this point were two main factors that stuck in my mind. The first thing I remember is her having a spay bottle full of lube. About everything 10 sec. or so she would stop, spray, say ""do you like it wet, baby?"", and check her phone for messages. The second thing I remember is her phone ringing and she answered it, while Scott was doing her doggy style. He looked so sad, the entire time. I didn't blame him. We didn't watch the whole thing but she came out shortly after and left. When Scott came out, about 15 min. later he still had the same look on his face. Sad, but more of a disappointing kind of sad. Like when you meet your idol and you find out he/she is an asshole. I remember asking him, ""So did you have a good time?"". David and I were kinda laughing cause we knew he didn't. Then he said something I will never forget, ""It's not how I expected my first time to be.""",I inadvertently got my friends virginity taken away by a horrible hooker experience.

 Claimed to be pregnant with my partner's baby, then upped it to twins, then 'miscarried' when she should have started showing, then told my boyfriend's mother that I had murdered her babies with an STI she had gotten from me through him. 
 Waited for me outside of my workplace. Called my boss repeatedly asking if I was working. 
 Rang my parents' doorbell at 2am, and spoke to my mother, after having discovered their address by illegally accessing their medical records (she is a nurse). 
 Forced us to change my partner's phone number innumerable times, after having pretended to be everyone from one of my coworkers whom I was apparently sleeping with to our gym to our bank. 
 Threatened to stop my partner's immigration papers with rape accusations. 
 Driven past our home innumerable times. 
 Contacted all of my partner's friends (including the ones living in Latin America and told them he's a lying, cheating asshole (he left her for cheating on him, repeatedly).

AskReddit,c97u0je,"This was beautifully written. I agree with your points and I too did not like the story of WoL nor HotS story. 
 In my opinion, Starcraft and Brood War seem to be more of a well rounded story in terms of providing plot advancement and themes from multiple characters both while they are the protagonist and while they are in a supporting role. In Starcraft 2 (both WoL and HotS) the story seems overtly and painfully linear where it feels as if no plot progresses nor do characters develop without going through the current protagonist. In the case of WoL, if Jim Raynor did not participate in the drama/interact with the character then it felt as if nothing happened. The same euphoria occurred with Kerrigan in HotS. This linearity in story telling made it feel as if I was watching a teen drama on TV with semi repetitive SC gameplay to break up the pace. Side characters felt as if they had no plot of their own and often times plot themes and characters were brought back for nostalgia purposes alone. [While playing through the campaign of HotS, I was reflecting on the story of Brood War and remembered the betrayal between Stukov and Duran. This led me to wonder how the UED would react to Stukov's and, more importantly, DuGalle's deaths if the Expeditionary Fleet ever returned to Earth (or their presumed deaths if it did not). Sure enough one or two missions later there is Stukov back in the game with some outrageous plot point that brought him back from the dead.] (/spoiler) 
 I did, however, enjoy the change of pace that the Hyperion mission provided in HotS. I do agree that it had no plot relevance though. 
 As for Diablo III, I am not sure how to eloquently describe a dumpster fire. The story took a left turn to nostalgia and rewriting its own book. The plot was a combination of Diablo and Diablo II with the intent to kill off all ties to the previous two games. The story structure, which followed the Act setup that II did, felt like a carbon copy of II with different bosses placed in the same settings. This along with the dumbed down mechanics really put me off for that game. I simultaneously felt no ties to the previous two stories and felt as if I was playing the same plot mechanics. I cried a little on the inside after beating the game and it was not because of the ""plot twist"" of the story.","Blizzard hired mentally challenged snails to write the story to Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty, Diablo III, and Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm."
AskReddit,c8n9ngj,"Not me, but a university friend from a couple years ago. He was a foreign exchange student from Saudi Arabia studying at my university. We were doing our engineering homework together when he started asking me about American girls- how to talk to them, how to ask them on a date, how often I had sex with my gf, etc. 
 We were talking about how, as a guy, it can be difficult to have sex again immediately after orgasm. Then he lifts his elbow up, tilts his head and points down at his neck and says, ""Yeah because it drains the fluid from your back."" 
 I was very puzzled and asked him to explain what he meant. He was 100% convinced that semen was stored in your spine. And that his spinal fluid was the same fluid as his semen. Not knowing what to say, I just sat there with raised eyebrows and a look of disbelief. And then he looked at me wide eyed, as if to let me in on a super amazing secret. 
 He leaned over and asked quietly, ""Do you want to know how to replenish your fluid?"" I was still trying to process the information when he says with total confidence, ""Shrimp! Eat shrimp! it will replenish your fluid."" 
 The seriousness with which he presented his working knowledge of male anatomy sent me over the edge in hysterical laughter.

AskReddit,c5ale6t,"It sounds like you're addicted to always being (or just feeling) busy, which is a rough place to be. You're not happy or unhappy, you're just working. It feels kind of like a weird limbo because you've paused every other aspect of life because you're working all the time. 
 Workaholism is a mental illness, it's an addiction. And it's not necessarily making you a better employee. The key difference is working smart vs working hard and the basic problem with workaholics is that since we're okay with staying longer, it takes us longer to get done what should have taken a shorter amount of time. As you've mentioned, it's taking a toll on your relationships with others and your life in general. I know so well that's it's hard to stop, but you have to do it. 
 As a former campaign hack where at peak times you're working 80-90 hours, I know the feeling. I had no evenings or weekends, there were no happy hours or hobbies. But I was working! I felt so righteous about the things I was getting done and the sacrifices I was making. But those sacrifices take a toll. When the campaign was done, I had no one to call because I had lost touch with the outside world. Thus began another vicious cycle of just working more again to fill the time. 
 When I got off campaigns and into a normal job I used to get this panic-like feeling when I would see others leaving at 6, like ""Why are you all leaving? There's so much work we need to do and it's still so early!"" Frankly it took me a long time to undo the damage, to not freak out when I had free time and fill it with other things that I thought I needed to do (but really could have been spaced out better). To really get out of the cycle it took a conscious effort. I would force myself to leave just a little bit earlier each time and once I got to leaving at 7pm I started scheduling non work activities. I took up martial arts again, having the set days and times helped me be okay with leaving the office early for those. The top things I keep in mind when I look at things later in the day are ""Will the company really lose money if I don't do this? Will I actually be fired if this waits until tomorrow? Is it really  that  critical?"" 
 Now that I work less I've rebuilt those relationships with friends, I don't feel guilty about not working all the time, and I have time to relax, go on vacations, and not be teetering on the edge of completely imploding all the time. It's hard to break the cycle of working all of the time, but it's worth it! It's incredibly cliche, but life is too short and what use is all of that money if you aren't able to spend it? What use is living in an a beautiful city if you don't see it?","Workaholism is an addiction and it's incredibly difficult to break the addiction to being busy, but it's worth all of the effort."
AskReddit,c9jx8mh,"My brother and I were getting older and were starting to have doubts about the whole Santa thing. (I was 8, he was six). It was close to Christmastime and my brother and I had accidentally discovered the Christmas presents stashed in the attic while playing hide-and-seek, so we knew something was up. ""Why why Santa let our parents get our presents early?"", we thought. So we decided we were going to confront our mom about it. Fortunately my tooth was lose at the time, and that provided a great opportunity. Not only would we find out about Santa, but about the Tooth Fairy as well. 
 So soon after that, I pulled my tooth and showed my mom. ""Great!"", she said, ""I guess you'll be getting a visit from the Tooth Fairy tonight!"" So that night when she was tucking us in, I came out and asked her ""Mom, is the tooth fairy real?"" 
 ""Of course the tooth fairy's real,"" replied mom. 
 ""I don't believe you"", I said. 
 Mom told us that we need to get to sleep, so we complied and she left the room. But my brother and I decided that we would not go to sleep until we found out the truth. We walked out into the hallway/laundry room area, where my mother was getting clothes out of the dryer. ""Mom, really, is the tooth fairy real? We're not going to sleep until you tell us the truth"" 
 Mom acted like she was starting to get a bit agitated, but she handled herself well. ""All right"", she said, ""There's not an  actual  tooth fairy. But,"" she said cheerily as if she was trying to not take away the childhood magic of belief in the Tooth Fairy, ""I come into your room  late at night  in my little tutu and my wings and my wand and get your tooth and turn it into money!"" 
 That satisfied us for the moment, so we went back to bed. But it didn't satisfy us for long. It actually made us think of more questions. What about the Easter Bunny, or the sand man, and Santa? So we marched back out into the hallway. ""Mom, if you're the Tooth Fairy, does that mean you're Santa too? We found the presents in the attic.""

AskReddit,c4bh8ig,"I posted this story once before but I can't find it, so here goes: 
 My cousin married a great guy a few years back who grew up in the town over from me.  One day he asked me if I knew a certain name, because the guy had gone to my high school.

Apparently the two of them worked in the same office.  It was soon after my cousin's marriage and I didn't want to act like I was whining to someone who was now family.  So I said, ""yeah... we... went to elementary school together.  I can't really speak to anything about him since."" 
 Fast-forward about a year, and I'm hanging out with the new cousin-in-law again.  He says, ""oh by the way, you hated  _ , didn't you?""  He had figured it out by my response (I try to make a point of praising people who aren't around, and I'm sort of upbeat in general), and, since he already knew, I admitted it and told him some horror stories. 
 ""Oh, you're gonna love this then,"" he says.  Turns out they didn't just work in the same office, my cousin-in-law was the dude's boss.

It happens quite often to underpowered groups of people where they develop a culture or attitude that causes them to perpetually keep themselves down they internalize as a whole the oppression put on them even and most evidently when they are not currently being oppressed. Women have been oppressed for thousands of years so this effect can be manifasted in the most complicated and nuanced ways they are the prime candidate for this effect, because no group has ever be oppressed as long as women have. I remember reading something about an island that was pretty much culturally removed from the outside world and the people of the island were well known to be pretty healthy. Soon after american television programming started coming into the island the island had its first reported cases of anorexica, and subsequently the islands pertanage of anorexic a girls grew until it was as high as it is here in the united states. To be clear before their TVs started to receive american programming anorexica was unheard of and I used this example mostly to shown how powerfull cultural programming can be. There was another study that asked black children which doll they preferred to play with a black one or a  white skinned one. Most of the black children choose the  white  one. So cultural mentalities can be pervasive without being obvious. Women have only gained the right to vote 83years ago.Even now we don't have a constitution amendment to treat women equally under the law.If you can't tell I'm writing this on a  phone Google search for equal rights amendment to learn more. Its shocking how many times this simple amendment was shot down my congress.  Okay I've been all over the place cultural programming  can change how we think in the deepest ways while being subtitle. The phenomenon may explain why gay men dress and behave more feminin because being attracted guys makes them feel that they should be culturaly receptive to the cultural message that only girls are usual receptive to.Though to be honest I don't know if  feminine gay men is anything more then a  hollywood stereotype.I've been watching the youtuber feminist frequency.She has a couple of videos that not only address how women are depicted in video games but in movies as well. Like over 9/10 movies has a male protagonist. The protagonist in the movie is usually the one who suffers, complishes things, and leades other people. This leaves women largely culturally out of the picture of those three roles.So our movies are saying that men are the ones that get stuff done.For women that leaves them to be pretty and get saved. I wrote this on my phone and I was all over the place so",women dress up and look fancy far more then men do because of subtle but strong cultural/societal influences.

AskReddit,cc2k8l9,"I was hanging out with some friends at Sonic after some sand volleyball. We all decided that we wanted Pizza Hut instead, which was just across a street and vacant lot. A few us just take off running, because he had some energy still. Also, I was wearing sandals. 
 Well, my friend is running about 10 feet to my left, and just a couple of feet in front of me. Now, at the other end of the lot, there is a 2 and a half foot tall retaining wall that goes up into the Pizza Hut parking lot. My friend gets there first, and she goes to plant for the jump, but there is a small ditch that was hidden by the grass. Luckily, she was able to just collapse and stop short of the wall. I see this happen right as I go to plant for my jump, and all my foot finds is air. Now, I'm a 300 lb guy, running at a decent clip. There's no way I'm able to just collapse. So, my planting foot just keeps going, and makes contact with the wall. In nothing but sandals. My big toe is all that makes contact. I hit, fall face forward, and almost bash my fave into the parking lot.

AskReddit,c6t6eif,"Growing up, I lived alone with my dad. Over the years, I've had to call 911 for my father at least twice a month due to hypoglycemic attacks from his diabetes. He managed it as best he could, but as those of you who have the disease know, diabetes is extremely testy. In many cases, he would simply start to lose his ""logical consciousness"" as I call it, and he would enter a dream-like, almost catatonic state. As a pre-teen this was very scary, especially when it happened in public. 
 When I was about 10, I woke up around 3am, with no distintive reason for waking up besides the feeling that ""I need to get up now."" I heard a noise from my dad's room, went to go check him, and he was violently shaking on the bed. The bed sheets were soaked with sweat, and he was completely unconscious. Luckily, I had already had an experience with this before, and I immediately called 911, told them he was ""shocking out."" The next 10-15 minutes of the ambulance coming was unbearable. I had checked his blood sugar when I called 911, and the meter read 32. (That's low, if you were wondering). 10 minutes later, I checked it again and it read 9. No lie, it said 9. A healthy adult should be between 90-130 on the glucometer, anything higher is unhealthy, and anything lower than 50 can start to produce the ""shocking out"" effects. (If you saw A Beautiful Mind, the insulin treatment Nash receives in the hospital is the exact thing I saw any time my dad went into shock) After the medics came, it took my dad a full 14 hours to regain consciousness, and the paramedics were absolutely stunned that he survived. 
 Every single time he woke up in the hospital, he would look over at me and say ""thanks again."" This hit me so hard because it showed his humility in a way a son shouldn't have to see in his father. (On a lighter note, I got rewards like a game or something any time it happened :P ) 
 These attacks occurred very frequently, until he received a pancreas transplant in 2004. He has been diabetes-free for 8 years now, but he has residual vision and nerve damage for having the disease since '77. In all the ""I shouldn't be alive"" scenarios, my father definitely nicks the top of my list for dodging death dozens of times over the course of the past 15 years.

AskReddit,c77iog4,"First I'd like to say that I think  mishagale  has a fabulous point, and gives me a new perspective. 
 At any rate - 
 I'm an American. I don't think the pledge itself is creepy (though I do think it's a load falsities, which I'll get to momentarily) but I think the amount of importance and fervor that a lot of people have about it is creepy. There are so many people in this country, where, if you don't believe in the pledge and don't participate in it (such as myself) you are castigated and made out to be some horrible anti-american terrorist monster. (Being a bit dramatic, yes, but some people really do react in that manner). I think it's creepy (bordering scary) how much fervor surrounds the pledge. Of course, the way I am, any sort of fanaticism frightens me, really. 
 The reason  I  don't believe in the pledge as it stands today is for a couple reasons. 
 A) The majority of people who border fanaticism when it comes to the pledge, do so with the thought process that ""America was built on Christian principles and if you don't do the pledge; you hate both America AND God"" 
 And, the thing is, the pledge was originally written and put into use around 1892, but the words ""under God"" were not added until 1954. I tend to be a purist about a lot of things, I prefer the original, not the remixed, added to, or improved. The pledge of Allegiance was never supposed to have anything to do about God, even though it was written by a Christian (and a fascist by the way... which would actually bring me to reason ""B"") 
 B) In a country that has (throughout history) been constantly been so whipped up about Fascism, Socialism, Dictatorship, and Communism - I find it extremely ironic that people are so fervent about protecting and participating in this pledge that was written by a Fascist. I myself, would find it hypocritical to do so, and I do not. 
 C) The real and main reason I don't participate in the pledge of Allegiance is because I find it to be absolute crap. It's supposed to be what this Nation stands for, and does it? Sure compared to some countries it may... But think about it - 
 ""One Nation Under God""  - Are we? because I'm pretty sure that America has many religions (some of which don't have a ""God"" or at least not a God in the manner of which the pledge refers to). Also America has many people who don't believe in God. 
 ""Indivisible""  - Are you sure about that? I'd say we're a country very divided, about almost everything. Religion, Politics, Class, Race, Nationality, Sexuality and so on, and so forth. 
 ""with liberty and justice for all""  - Well, I won't harp on this one really, compared to many countries we do have a lot of liberties and a better justice system. 
 anyway...",As an American I find people's fanaticism over The Pledge of Allegiance to be kind of frightening. I myself don't believe in the Pledge and don't participate because I think it's hypocritical.

Its not an undergraduate degree, your responsibilities won't be just taking tests and nothing else (usually, if its health related, but I'm not quite sure what you're going for) but you will do independent research, maybe teach, and write publications. All of these things take  way  more time than they should, and can't be brushed aside like that paper you write at 4 in the morning or test you pull an all nighter studying for.

AskReddit,ckp3blb,"I'd say it was probably detrimental for me to be labeled gifted, everyone calling me smart, etc. I skipped a grade in elementary school and was still labeled gifted for the grade I skipped into. The problem was I never got challenged as a kid, through any sort of compulsory education. The gifted program was honestly just a couple of afternoons in a different classroom, doing exploratory topics in math/science and the like. 
 I guess I pick things up a little more quickly, but I've honestly got a terrible work ethic when it comes to doing things I don't enjoy (procrastinate/half-ass a lot of stuff). However, my parents were always very conscientious of my grades, so any slacking off I do is limited by the fact that I absolutely must get an A. In everything. 
 And therein lies the problem: I could slack off whilst getting As. It was depressingly easy in elementary/middle school. I went to a special high school that was super selective (offered honors, AP, and college courses such as Organic and Polymer chemistry). But I was still smart enough to get As there without any real struggle (attend class + do the homework + maybe 30min review before tests = A). 
 Now I go to what many consider to be the best engineering school in the world. Even here, I could be considered smart. I have to work harder than in high school, but I compare how much time I spend doing homework or studying with what my friends do, and I'm slacking. It is kind of depressing, and I have developed a slight self-hatred for the fact that I am this good at learning. I see my friends working hard and doing worse than I am, and I truly believe they deserve to do better than me. It makes me feel like shit. Still have a perfect GPA. Part of me wants to just get that first B so that I'll finally end my habit of doing barely enough to achieve perfection (but then I get scared that if I lose that lower bound, I'll just spiral into nothing). 
 I think my only saving grace is that if I'm doing something that I love, then I can do it forever. Just so happens that what I love doing, programming, is also highly lucrative. Oftentimes I find myself working on a cool new project and forgetting to eat/sleep. I'll probably land a job at some big corporation that likes hiring from my school and surf through the rest of my life.",Became a lazy ass at a renowned engineering school.

AskReddit,c7046ho,"I would like to gently disagree. Turn signals being used every time is encouraged mostly for good habit and situations where the driver may not be aware of all the surroundings. However, the signal light is mostly for traffics that share the road, technically it's a form of communication between everything  on road , including bikers / motorcyclists. But pedestrians are on a total different system. You are NOT suppose to share the road, unless at a cross walk. And if you have the right of way then he has to wait, or otherwise you have to. He doesn't need to signal you anything. Just because there's no car on the road / in the way doesn't make you crossing a road correct and him wasting your time wrong. 
 Signals can only be useful for pedestrians if: 
 
 you are breaking the rule, but sees his signal light to avoid conflict 
 he might break the rule, but you see his signal to give him way 
 
 I can see how no.2 would be reasonable considering how many shit drivers there are, but the problem of that is more about reckless driving than not signalling.","yes one should always signal as a good habit, but not for the situations you described."

Anyway, I queued up by myself for a random League of Legends game and decided to play AP Shaco. That was back when the meta wasn't really established and you could play pretty much anything anywhere. I was put bot lane with a riven. I think she was the newest champion at the time. So Riven and I head down to bot lane and I start dropping boxes. Enemies walk into the bush, BAM! First blood. I put down some more boxes, they respawn, BAM! Double kill. Things are going well for me. I start getting some props from the Riven and I'm getting pretty far ahead. Then, their mid and jungler gank. I fall pretty quickly and now Riven is desperately trying to get run away. She has just a sliver of health left when she runs into a nest full of my boxes. Double Kill! Triple Kill! Quadra Kill!!!

AskReddit,c5g2l6v,"A few weeks ago I ordered a washer and dryer from a home improvement store. I had to call the store directly because their website wasn't working even though it's a widely known national chain. Anyway, the guy who answers the phone in appliances immediately says he will have to call me back. Even though I was a little annoyed, I agreed. When he does call me back, he immediately puts me on ""hold"" because he had too many customers in the store. Wtf?! Why would you call me back then? He proceeds to put me on hold about five more times, but his idea of hold is putting the phone on the counter while he speaks to other people. I can hear their conversations. 
 Fast forward a week, they don't have the washer and dryer in stock. I was never told that they wouldn't be in stock for my scheduled delivery. After raising my voice, they upgraded my washer and dryer for no charge. When they deliver that w/d the next day, the delivery guys say it won't fit. So they take it back to the store, mess up the return, but luckily I got it corrected. I go to the store and pick out a w/d that same day of my delivery to be delivered now 4 days later. 
 They called me on that delivery date saying they can't find the washer. I'm like I was told this was in stock and it would be no problem to be delivered on time. So they promise me they will deliver it a week later. By the time, that one would have been delivered it would have been a month from my original order. Yes I had too much patience in this.

AskReddit,c16pk0s,"Go with #2.  All of the other options amount to some level of covering up your mistake.  You should always own your mistakes.  Doing so makes you look confident, responsible, trustworthy, and (perhaps most importantly) introspective.  Hiding your mistakes makes you look deceitful, conniving, unsure of yourself, irresponsible, and potentially incompetent.  Particularly if you're on your last week of work, demonstrating that you actually still care about what you're doing will leave your supervisor with a lasting positive impression of you. 
 Moreover, you should never pay personally for a mistake you make on behalf of the company.  First of all, the mistake was made when you were acting as a representative of the company, so it's the company's obligation to deal with it.  Second of all, the amount of money you're talking about is chump change to most companies (think about it - it's less than your weekly  post-tax  salary, and you're only one of presumably many employees).

AskReddit,c5lfxxf,"I  was  the terrible date in this story. 
 A little backstory: I was 17 when I got my first serious girlfriend. She was bat-shit crazy and super hot. She had this incredible psycho-sexual hold over me. We were in a consistent cycle of break-up make-up and one poor girl got caught in the middle of it. 
 This story starts during one of our breaks. I'm feeling forlorn because my girlfriend (crazy level: cult leader) has dumped me for like the sixth time that year. My aunt takes pity on me and suggests I give her friend's daughter a call because she's single, attractive, and sane. 
 I call her up and ask her out, she says yes and we go out on a date. Everything's cool. She sounds a little like Jack Nicholson when she talks, but otherwise she's great. Very attractive and very smart. Just an all around great girl. We make a date for the following week. 
 During the week I tell a couple of friends about the date and how this girl is pretty cool. I lived in a small town, so within a few days word gets back to my ex that I've been on a date with this girl. Crazy mode engage! 
 Somehow she figures out what movie we're planning to see and gets in line right behind us! One minute we're standing in line joking and the next thing I know all the hairs stand up on the back of my neck in response to the waves of crazy she's giving off. I slowly turn my head and am not really surprised to find El Loco standing right behind me. The psycho-sexual hold kicks in and I start talking to her, even though some part of my brain is trying to remind me that this is obviously making my date uncomfortable. 
 We get our tickets and sit down and guess who decides to sit right next to us. It was the most uncomfortable date I'd ever been on. But it gets worse. 
 After the movie the ex follows us to the parking lot, all the way to my truck. I turn around finally and ask her what's going on. She says her ride left without her and I need to give her a ride home. Psycho-sexual hold kicks in and I say OK. My date is flabbergasted. I was driving a little dodge dakota with a bench seat so my date ends up sitting between me and my ex who starts talking about how great it was seeing the movie with the two of us, because it can be lonely seeing a movie by yourself, etc. The whole time I'm just grinding my teeth and cursing my scumbag penis-brain. Scumbag penis-brain is also very logical and subconsciously plots out the quickest route to get everyone home. The next thing I know I'm dropping my date off at her house. With my ex still in the truck. My date doesn't even look at me she just sprints up her front walk and runs into her house. 
 I don't really remember driving crazy home, but I do remember my mom's face when I got home. She was fucking livid, she was still on the phone with my aunt who was also super pissed because my date's mom, her best friend, had called her when my date finally broke down into tears and told her the whole humiliating story. 
 I should have left as soon as I saw that crazy bitch in line.",Ended up on a date with a nice girl AND my crazy bitch exgirlfriend. Tears ensued.

Same thing as you, she would frequently meet with him when I wasn't available, and on occasion ditch me to hang out with him. She called my jealousy unreasonable and my suspicion stupid.

 So I was sitting in class minding my own business when my ex's friend (she is a woman, I'm a man) who I will call Charlotte texts me with a simple ""hey.""

""Hey ex-girlfriend, wouldn't it be hilarious if I sent this to Charlotte?"" many lawls were had and the obvious joke ended there. 
 Fast forward. I respond to Charlotte's text with, ""whatsup Charlotte? :)"" right along with a picture of my penis. as soon as I see the outgoing text my heart drops. I'm sitting in class and my face goes completely white and my friend sitting next to me even noticed something was wrong. I couldn't stop it and the deed was done. I had to think quickly. 
 Naturally, my best bet was to just hope she thought I was insane. I went on with the conversation as normal. she responded with ""???... not much???"" and I responded with ""oh thats nice, blah blah blah"" but word traveled fast and I knew I was going to have to man up to what I did in order to not dig myself too deep a hole. So when she called after class to ask ""WTF?"" I was like, ""opps, sorry"" and that was that.

AskReddit,cb3gts7,"I got asked to go to a college football game with this guy from high school. Football is a big deal where I'm from so, even though in high school this guy wasn't that bright, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and agreed to go. 
 First, I asked him what to wear, he said to dress upscale because of the company we were going to be around. When he pulled up to my house I was putting on the finishing touches. I had curled my hair, done my nails, bought a new dress, new shoes, new jewelry, gotten my eyebrows waxed--the works. I walk out to meet him and he was wearing a FUCKING t-shirt and ripped jeans. I should have defined what he meant by ""upscale"". No big deal. It's just one hiccup. 
 The stadium is about two hours away so we set out. The whole ride was us in the car for two hours together while he did nothing but talk about himself. He talks about his ambitions to quit his career paying job to go back to a community college and play football. He tells me how this career job is just like my job...but better. He then goes on to say his greatest aspiration in life is to go back to our high school to coach ball. It was at that moment that I began texting anyone and everyone I knew to help me ditch this dude. 
 Once we get to the stadium he forgets where we're tailgating. I walk around in the southern heat for two hours with this idiot savant trying to find the right tailgating tent. By the time he damn well figures it out I am wilted, sweaty, and pissed off and it is time for the game to start. 
 Then I find out HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TICKETS TO THE MOTHER FUCKING GAME. At this point I try to calm myself down. He's just nervous I tell myself. It'll be fine. It was not. He found some tickets for cheap. Any of you who watch football know that the worst place to sit is on the sunny side. Guess where I was. The nosebleed sunny side. Fucking-a. 
 After finding our seats, he throws his hot-ass jacket on me and says ""I'm getting food."" and walks away. I'm thinking ""ok, that'll be nice. I'm hungry anyway."" He comes back with ONE hot dog for himself. Which he eats. In front of me. ""oh, did you want something?"" he asks. ""It would have been nice considering all the walking we did if you would get me a water,"" I said. ""oh, you want me to get?"" ......-_- 
 So the game starts. It's my favorite team playing so I decide it can't get worse from here. We score almost automatically. Crowds roaring. Kickoff. I turn my head to watch the ball and my eye catches something not right. This guy has his whole damn finger in his nose. In pubic. While every head in the place is turned toward him. Digging for buried treasure. He turns and looks at me, finger still in nose, and goes ""what? I almost got it!"" 
 I ignore him the rest of the game. Which we win by a landslide. It's coming down to the end of the 4th quarter and I suggest leaving. Which he says is something a true fan doesn't do. By the time we finally get out of the stadium, find the lost car, and get through traffic he decides we need to eat somewhere. Fuck. At this point I have texted everyone, including my mother, and I hate them all because they have abandoned me (for insignificant things like work and children) in this hellhole of a situation. I'm stuck with this dipshit. 
 Everywhere is crowded. Duh...it's after the football game you sorry son of a bitch. You should have left when I told you to. I am sunburned, dehydrated, sweaty, wilted, and pissed. We manage to get into an Olive Garden. The gay waiter (bless him) pulls me aside and gives me a free wine taster before we even sit down and says ""honey, you're either on the worst date ever or you're preforming a civil service for the mental institution. Here...drink."" Best part of the night. 
 On the way home I don't speak. He doesn't even notice because he's still talking about himself. 
 I get home and get out of the car. ""bye, thanks"". And run inside. I close and lock the door and thank the heavens this night is over. 
 Then: knock, knock, knock. The sorry bastard invites himself in to talk to my parents....who love him! What is wrong with these people who gave birth to me??

AskReddit,c1mvs50,"I think because the government actually does respond to popular opinion. They did play American-style in the early days, but as stories of kids getting into piles of debt and dragging their parents into the hole with them started showing up in the media, they cracked down hard on credit card issuance. But on top of keeping fees low, they also instituted heavy restrictions on just who could get a credit card. Must have a stable job, for one. Maximum credit limit offerable by the issuer, for another (max is 50k RMB, which comes out to about US$7k-8k these days). It does seem unbelievable, but it works. 
 And yeah, some of the banks here have a prepaid option. I can walk into the credit card center of the local ""main"" branch of ICBC and ask for a  prepaid Visa  card issuing fee and I have a card with RMB and US$ accounts. Walk into a branch and deposit US$ or RMB as needed (US$ for overseas use and RMB for local use) And they have agreements with various banks around the world to deposit money into your account while overseas (in the US they have more than one partner, though the only one I remember is Chase). No overdraft fees either; if you overdraft they just freeze your account until you pay it off, simple as that (though if you take longer than a month to do that they start going after you in court, I believe). I know there's an ATM fee that's, I think, 15RMB/withdrawal (US$2.25?). Only drawback is it can't be used online (something to do with regulations on  foreign-currency cash versus debt; the only quibble I have with the banking system here is with the Kafka-esque mess surrounding foreign transactions).","Yes, we have prepaid Visa cards, see if you can find someone who's coming here to sign up for one if you want it because once you do you can do pretty much everything with it except shop online. And voila, your first offshore account. 
 As an aside; there's a minimum income requirement for banks to issue ""Gold"" credit cards here. The Japanese government recently decided to use the ability to get one in determining eligibility for tourist visa issuance, so for some, it's not just a line of credit. I wonder whose bright idea that was, because it only increases reliance on them, but their country, their rules, I guess."
AskReddit,cd0iewg,"I had an accidental overdose on acetaminophen last year. I was incredibly ill, the yearly flu, migraines, the whole nine yards.

AskReddit,c8i5urf,"I did. I'm a guy and I was 18, we were having a New Years party at one of our friends houses.  Her parents loved to drink & smoke, had a small pool table,small Jacuzzi thing, and bar downstairs.  That made a great place for us to hang out, drink and party.
Anyway, On New Years Night.. my friends and I got a bottle of Yukon Jack and took it with us.  We drank/partied for most of the night like normal, then I sort of black out for a while.. 
 I kind of come to, and I'm sitting at the kitchen table with my bottle of Yukon, another bottle of Yukon and my friend's mom.  Everyone else was passed out drunk by now, I have no idea what time it was but late.   I had no idea how I got there so I'm kind of processing the situation, and she just says ""STOP!"", I'm start to freak out a little bit cause I have no idea what's going on...
Then she says, ""Stop, looking at tits.. I like it. You like them don't you.""  I was pretty drunk and this was a longgg time ago now so I don't remember too much else of the conversation.

 John O'Hurley got out of the car and, when he began speaking, sounded just like J. Peterman. Hilarious 
 Got to chat with Dave Chappelle for several minutes. He wanted nothing to do with checking in or handling his bags.

AskReddit,cq3dupv,"My younger brother by 2 years is autistic. I'd say he's about a 6 on a scale of 0 being ""normal"" (I hate phrasing it that way) and 10 being the extreme case. He's 18 now, and though he's definitely come out of his shell, growing up with him was tough. 
 When we were young I wasn't really aware of his condition and got annoyed at our parents giving him what seemed like special attention. As I got older, I got to be more understanding and protective of him, especially as kids in our school were massive dicks to him. That made me despise bullies more than anything else in the world. I even got in a few fights when others were either picking on him directly or I heard them make fun of him behind his back. He never really had friends growing up. He'd just go to school and back, him not being able to easily interact with others and nobody wanting to be with him. My friends did what they could to look out for him, but once we graduated he was well and truly alone. It saddened me to see him go through his school years basically by himself. 
 A common trend with autistic kids is to get really caught up in specific interests, and for my brother it was world history and Pokemon. A strange combo, I know, but he was into it so our family did what they could to make him happy. Luckily, I fucking loved Pokemon as a kid and we still play the games today. This common interest made it easier for me to communicate with him, and we're pretty close, but we've definitely had our own issues. 
 He's always been a momma's boy. I think it's because our mom babied him too much for too long, but I can't really blame her. The thing is that he's much less close to our dad, who he regularly tells ""I HATE YOU!"", ""I HOPE YOU DIE!"", ""I WISH YOU WEREN'T MY DAD!"" etc for the smallest things. Our dad's great, he's done so much for us, and I can tell that whenever my brother says stuff like that it kills him inside. To raise a kid for 18 years for them to fluctuate between loving you, being silent, and outright despising you must be harder than I can imagine. He's even acted the same way to me a few times, and it gives the worst feeling. 
 Now,  this part may sound awful, and I feel terrible writing it.  But having an autistic brother has made me more understanding of parents who want to give up, or even abort, children with genetic and mental handicaps. Political correctness aside, whenever I read an article about people criticising someone for not wanting to care for a handicapped child I think that they're full of shit and could never understand the hardships. My brother isn't even close to being the extreme, but I've grown up seeing my parents struggle massively. I love him with every fibre of my being, I'm not at all saying I wish he was gotten rid of. He's my boy, my bro, my homie, my reason for working hard. All I'm saying is that I can appreciate how daunting it can be for someone to find out that the child they wanted to be healthy is born with an issue that 1) Will leave the child at a disadvantage compared to others and 2) make being a parent even more difficult than normal. 
 I know that autism is genetic, and as a result I have a higher chance of having an autistic child. Honestly, I don't think I could raise one if their's was more severe than my brothers. I feel awful typing that, but it's true.","Younger autistic bro

AskReddit,cnumsvs,"I have a fascination with historical empires and the cultural advances that came with each of them. Which is why I have to choose BSkyB/Fox and all the other Murdoch related enterprises. Forgive me if this isn't incredibly well informed, but I think it's an opinion some people may agree with and even have more evidence to support. It's an extremely influential conglomerate corporation that's trying to corner the market in sports entertainment, news television, movies and television in general. So far so big business, meh, whatever. However, the influence this corp has is then used to keep a large swath of the United States repeating and believing in thinly veiled racist dogma, us vs them thought patterns and staunchly anti-liberal/democratic ideals all to make a profit on the fear and hatred of those who are different to ""us"". Whenever you hear about uninformed, illiterate or plain stupid people holding political offices in America, chances are they're the result of 1984-esque brain-washing television that's designed to create and recycle ignorance, fear and hate, courtesy of Mr Rupert ""it's not my fault I allowed phone hacking in my main company led by my own son to occur but all Muslims should be accountable for random terrorist acts because fuck foreigners, right?"" Murdoch. Of course, being anti-liberal isn't inherently evil, as you can take a right wing view in life and still be a decent person, but Fox and co so blatantly want to promote the far right side, which is filled with lies, a lack of empathy for those with less than us (unless they're in a womb, for some bloody reason that makes us priceless but birth takes our value away) and promotion of selfishness, greed and inequality. 
 ...sorry, rant over. It saddens me to see what that asshole has done for holding back the culture of such a promising superpower. I'm sure there are other factors involved but if he and his ilk didn't poison American minds through the powerful communicative device of T.V, I imagine the recent cultural renaissance (gay marriage, weed, black President and so on) could have arrived sooner, or been even more substantial by this point in time.","Sky/Fox are dicks and Bill O Reilly should just die, and preferably he'd do it live."
AskReddit,crk3zrb,"A neighbor girl from a kinda uptight/religious family. 
 It was a summer evening and me and the other girls from our block were all hanging out all day riding bikes and talking and whatnot and we decided to have a slumber party at one of our houses. The sheltered girl was there while the rest of us were making plans and she asked if she could come too. We obviously said yes, not even just to be polite, but because we'd all been hanging out all day and no one had a problem with it. Well it turns into this big deal with her mom wanting to talk to the parents and making sure we go to bed on time and don't sleep in late because her daughter had church in the morning and whatnot, so everyone's starting to get a little annoyed by her mom, but whatever. The night goes on and we all get together at one of the girl's houses and watch movies. We're talking about celebrities and blah blah and how hot so and so is, but the sheltered girl is not talking at all. I try to get her involved in the conversation and ask her which guy she liked from the movie and she got all defensive and blurts that she is a virgin and she's going to practice abstinence and she doesn't need to date until she's older.. No one is challenging her, but now whenever we talk she starts like quoting bible verses and just talking about being abstinent and pure, and my friend gets annoyed and tells her to shut the fuck up, and the sheltered girl yells back at her that she is going to hell. Awkward enough, but we don't want to keep arguing with this girl so I just put in a new movie and we move on. Well within minutes this girl is asleep and snoring and we start talking amongst ourselves about how rude she was and she must think we're such bitches or something. We're all getting really mad the more we talk about it... 
 Well basically one thing led to another and the one girl she said was going to hell gets up and is like ""fuck it, if i'm going to hell I'm going down in flames."" She goes and gets all this random shit from the fridge--cream cheese and pickles and relish and horseradish.. She starts smearing it all over the sheltered girl while she's sleeping. We're all laughing and taking pictures and I even contributed by adding a dill spear to her open mouth like a cigar. And I'm just laughing the whole time. Finally she woke up to see us all laughing at her and she felt her face and started screaming. She ran to the bathroom and washed up and just cried the whole night. No one talked to her to see if she was ok or anything. Apparently at one point she called her mom and her mom came and got her at like 5 am and didn't say anything to anyone. I never talked to her again. 
 She is in her 20s and lives with her parents still. She's probably 300 lbs and barely leaves the house... just posts things on facebook about abortion and jesus and whatnot. (Yeah she kept me as a friend on facebook, god knows why). I just feel terrible about it. But then I'll see her posting all this hatred and bigotry and then I'm conflictedly proud of what I did. Ultimately though, I regret hurting her. There was a better way to handle that. Sorry neighbor girl!!",bullied a sheltered neighbor girl as a kid at her first ever sleepover.

AskReddit,cojbcjs,When I was at secondary school (high school for those state side) I was pretty introverted and often made excuses for not going out after school. My two 'best friends' at the time came round unannounced to my house and I pretty much had to invite them in. They were giggling as we went up to my room and said they had made me a present. They pulled out a cassette (aah the 90s) and told me to put it on. They had made an album of songs in one of the boys karaoke machine of them changing the lyrics of pop songs to abusing me and my shyness/lack of luck with ladies/fashion sense pretty much everything. The most pathetic part was I laughed along and pretended I found it as hilarious as they did. It only stopped when my mum who was walking past my room heard the abuse and came in told them both to get the fuck out of her house. I think I wasn't even mad about the whole incident I just sat there alone in my room and cried. I realised then finally that these people were not my friends and I'd be happier with no mates than them.

AskReddit,c3p5k4k,"I flew to Broome, Western Australia, to meet my then girlfriend for a 2 week long vacation. I arrived at 11pm the night before she was due to arrive. I hadn't made any accommodation plans for that night, I thought I would be able to find a backpackers relatively easy. I asked at one and they were full, so I thought ""fuck it"", and proceeded to walk 6 kilometres/4 miles to Cable Beach. 
 Here's the map: [ 
 It was a really bright night, no-one was around and it was really windy too, but I'm a sucker for these kind of adventures and I envisioned finding a cosy nook out of the way someplace to nap until morning. 
 I finally got to the beach about 1:30am and it was spooky as hell, there were some lights on at the resort and I thought about trying to sneak in, but thought better of it. I gathered my courage and walked down the dark track onto the beach, the wind whistling and fear taking me over. 
 I walked up the beach about 20 metres or so and went up near the dunes and dug myself out a shallow trench, curled up and tried to sleep. I kept waking up intermittently and twice I awoke to strange phenomena. 
 The first was about an hour after I lay down, I woke up to screaming, yelling and shouting. My eyes wide-open, my body frozen, I stared down toward the moonlit beach and saw a group of about 30 teenagers, all pushing eachother and screaming. They walked down the beach and disappeared. I didn't think that was too weird until the next morning when I realised there wasn't anybody about and nothing in the direction I saw them walking. The noise they made was horrendous, I don't mean loud, I mean frightening. 
 The next thing I saw, will stick with me forever. 
 Again, my eyes opened wide, my body frozen as if trying to sink lower into the beach sand. It must have been another hour or so after seeing the gang of teenagers. I saw a light moving down the waterline towards me. Now the tide had gone out quite which made the sand all wet and shiny. This light was about the size of a car headlight and moved towards me, then back a little, then forwards more, in this eerie patterned movement. 
 It got closer, until it was directly in line with where I was attempting respite. I freaked. It stopped and I felt it look at me. I've never felt so frozen with fear as I had at that point, but I didn't know what to do. I don't think I took a breath for a minute. 
 The 'light' then zipped off down the beach, along the water's edge and then it went  up  into the sky and began to move in geometrical ways that flying things shouldn't be able to perform, such as right-angles without change of pace etc.. I followed it with my eyes until it was the same size/brightness as a star and then eventually disappeared.",Slept on the beach and awoke to an eerie light that freaked me out.

AskReddit,cii7jzl,"Growing up my family saw and allowed extensive abuse of me. 
They also participated to varying extents of having me as their scape goat. 
After leaving home at 16 my grandmother felt it appropriate to share how hard I am to love. 
My other aunt has always found great pleasure out of stepping on me mentally to boost herself up. 
Keep in mind my family is middle class, successful and beautiful. 
I say this because it also represents how intelligent and smart and privileged they are. 
Lucky for me I am also the same. Re smart etc.
My family is very much driven by what HAS to be done.  Keeping up appearances.  And to an extent an element of security can be found in this. 
Being smart I have always been able to see what the underlying cause of their behaviors are. And while this allowed me to not get to affected by them, it meant I would always get subjected to them. 
Three years ago I made the decision to not participate anymore. And so simply stopped attending family gatherings and whatnot.
(Still very close to mum and sister) 
I can say with 100% honesty I am so much happier now. 
I used to be happy.  But also constantly aware and on gaurd. 
But now I am just so happy. 
It has allowed me to explore myself. Which is something I feel would have been impossible to do with the watchful,  judgemental eyes of my family. 
I feel like I am true to myself.  Even if that means getting depressed or quitting my high paying management job to not work and figure out who I am. 
 Every single thing about that decision has been rewarding. 
One of the best things to come out of it was my mum used to not really understand or see the passive/subtle behaviors. Basically it wasn't happening to her, so she couldn't relate to what the issue was. 
On my bday this year I received sms from the family, which I didn't feel compelled to respond to.  Mum started to nag me about it and I had to really put my foot down and explain how I would only be doing it because it was the right thing to do.  And that the truth was they weren't part of my life etc.
Anyway a few weeks ago mum had dinner with the family and they learned I wasn't working and that I was dating a much older man. 
They immediately start to roll their eyes and question my decisions etc.
Usually mum would have just let it happen.  Not gotten involved.  But let it happen.

 Me:  ""I'd like to return this book please."" 
Cashier:  ""I'm sorry, I can't do returns at this register.  You'll have to wait in line at one of the other registers.""

AskReddit,c3icvvp,"In the last semester of high school, I realized that the teachers were treating it as a joke so I might as well, too. I had always been a pretty smart guy who never did anything out of line, so they had no suspicions when I started asking to go to the bathroom every class period, even if I was gone for twenty minutes. During one of these breaks in the final period I went to the library and started rearranging the keys on the keyboards; taking all the B keys and putting them on one keyboard, putting Ctrl in the middle, just scattering them all around. After a few minutes of this, with help from a friend, the librarian walked past and shot a glance at us. My friend and I thought we were made, so we popped the rest of the keys on quickly and left. We assumed we got away with it because nobody came looking for us, so we forgot about it and laughed about making the librarian or the IT guys, both pretty anal about everything, having to pull off a bunch of keys and pull them from a big pile like a game of Scrabble. 
 A day or two later, the principal came to our Spanish class and asked to speak with us in a private office. We both knew what was up, and my friend had a look that said, ""I would rather kill myself than be in that room answering questions."" We got in and sat down, and the principal started with ""The librarian said she saw you two in the library a few nights ago..."". I cut her off and spun a tale about how my friend and I were actually in there putting the keys  back , but they were so screwed up that we couldn't do it all.

We were let go, and the smile on my friends face was worth it alone. 
 Also, when the new principal (different from the above one) sent out an email describing the horrid senior benefits he had agreed to (which was hardly anything at all, and far reduced to the benefits previous classes were allowed) I replied, ""Is this a joke? What are the real benefits?"". I'm not sure who I meant to send it to, but it went out to the whole school.

 I was interviewing for a tech writing position at an engineering company. The first part of the interview with the communications manager went really well and she brought me in to speak to the head of engineering. 
 He asked me lots of questions about organizing documentation and where what sections would go and why. At one point he starts asking about cars. He then wanted me to write a list of all the different parts of a car and, after completion of my list, separate them into sections (Something like safety, use, maintenance, etc). So I start listing parts and he keeps telling me to keep adding to it. 
 Eventually I've filled the whole page and he keeps telling me to continue. I maybe know slightly more about cars than the average 20something woman, but am by no means a car aficionado.

 i decided to try to forgive him, because i really love the man. i knew this wasn't really him and considering the fact that we'd been together such a long time and still very young i decided i could be able to get over it. that we could be able to get it through. 
 if you decide to forgive, you do not decide to forget. you can't forget and you shouldn't. but you have to figure out how not to let the incident take power over you, over your mind or over your actions. of course you will have to rebuild the trust that got lost and this is not quite easy as you're going to ask yourself things like who is it, what has she/he got, is he/she gonna do it again, what if this, what if that... and so on. it's gonna go away after awhile once you have rebuilt a piece of the trust. accept it's a process that takes its time. accept that it changes you. 
 it can break after a while or it can bring your relationship to a whole new, higher level, but both partners need to be wanting it and both need to work on those issues, it's lost when you're alone trying it. 
 me, i forgave him. it changed us. i became a very confident, open kind of person and our relationship works on a completely new level since we're both more aware.","i forgave him after cheating, requires time, confidence and the will, it can or can not fix your relationship, don't you ever forget your own worth"

AskReddit,cfa38rn,"Hey, brony here. Perhaps I can shed a little light on the situation. Bronies have been around for around 4 years now, and the whole situation has calmed down. Back when I first came into the fandom, there were very vocal haters abounding on the internet, and it was a problem. I'm not sure at what point your stepson joined the fandom, but back when it was getting started, many forums had mass bannings, as well as pony related threads being spammed with gore and porn images by those who didn't approve. Fortunately, the situation has calmed down over the years for several reasons. First, many bronies left 4chan in favor of the brony specific forum ponychan. Memebase added a special subsite for bronies, and eventually 4chan added /mlp/. Also, people have become accustomed to the idea that men watch a show that they assume is targeted at young girls. The creator of the show actually intended it to cross age and gender barriers in order to make a show that was enjoyable for anyone. I can also tell you that there are people who are vocal against it in real life. I live in a dorm, so we have all kinds of people. There are five or six bronies on my floor, and we will occasionally watch together in one of our rooms or the lounge. There are basically three types of non-bronies: first, those who speak against it because it's the ""cool""/ socially acceptable thing to do. 2. Those who say ""it's not for me, but if you like it, that's great. And 3. Those who for some reason feel it is unnatural/ homosexual/ bad for dudes to be watching it. I also can understand your stepson's hesitation in telling you, as there are many parents who jump to conclusions about the show and think there is something wrong with you (like my parents. I'll explain some details if I get a request).

AskReddit,c3lez64,"When I was a teenager my mother was an alcoholic and got around quite a bit as did her friends. 
 A friend of hers was staying over for some unknown reason to me one night when I was 17. She'd gotten there before my mom and gone to bed in her bed room. Later on my mom came home drunk with a random friend of hers who I'd heard her speak of but never I'd never actually seen him before. It was like 10 at night and I heard the Washing machine go off so I went to throw them in the dryer so I could go to bed. 
 With the way our apartment was set up I being all of five feet tall can't see around or over the bar to our kitchen and into the living room. I walk out, everything's really quiet and I figure she's gone to bed. I naturally look at the ground while I walk in the dark to ensure I don't step on shit and what not. I get half way through the living room before I actually look up. She hadn't gone to bed, her and this guy I'd only met that night were naked going at it on the couch. They didn't see or hear me at all, and I was already pretty much passed them when I noticed them. 
 So I chose to go the last few feet out of anger to her as I say now ""skanking around on the couch"" and I went and moved the laundry around. Well they heard the noise, scrambled to hide, I ignored them as I went back to my room. Thirty minutes or so later there's a knock on my door and my mother proceeds to tell me that she should be able to have sex in public areas of the house while I'm home and known to be awake.

AskReddit,c0n6x3f,"I told this story recently but I love it so I'm telling it again. 
 A few years ago I was in Boston visiting some friends and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I'm standing on the sidewalk, enjoying the autumn chill, and two cars screech to a halt in front of me. Neither moved for a minute and so I didn't think anything of it, just odd. Then, from seemingly out of nowhere, two cops come running at the cars with their guns drawn. 
 The cops were screaming, ""Motherfucker let me see your hands, don't move you fuck,"" all kinds of deliciously profane things to shout in the middle of the day in the middle of a city. They slapped the hood of the first car and yelled at the driver to take off and then stood on opposite sides of the rear car, their guns aimed through the windows and still screaming. A few moments later about ten cop cars pull up, lights and sirens, and cops start piling out with their guns drawn, a couple with shotguns that they racked and then leveled at the car. I was about twenty feet away but none of them seemed to even notice, I wasn't told to back away or anything. As this is happening, a small crowd began to gather. 
 So, since I'm on the passenger side, I can't see the driver. The cops open the door on my side and pull out the passenger. He was a normal looking guy, white guy in t-shirt and jeans, and they lay him down on the road, cuff him, and take him off to the squad car. So far, pretty interesting. 
 Then they take the driver out and lay him on the ground, but since he's on the other side of the car, I still can't see him. Cops then start pulling things out of the car and putting them on the hood, bottles of pills, a backpack, and then a gun. This is getting more interesting. Then, as we are all watching in rapt attention, this huge cop, black, probably 6'5 and about 300 pounds, reaches down to pick up the driver. He does so with one hand and we all stand in amazement as we realize the driver is a midget and is dangling from the hands of this gigantic cop. The midget is screaming at the top of his lungs, ""Fuck you cops, blah blah blah"" and the cop pretty much carries him one-handed to a squad car and throws him in the back. 
 When the cruiser takes off there was a moment of silence and then everyone, probably thirty bystanders, a dozen cops, everyone starts laughing hysterically at the same time. I called every single person I knew, just so that I would not be accused of making it up. It was hands down the funniest thing I have seen.",I saw a midget get arrested at gunpoint. There was much communal laughter.
AskReddit,cmd8rks,"The term ""rapier"" can be difficult to define. Generally, European swordsman did not categorise swords the way we do. 
 For example, Fiore dei Liberi, a 14th century master of arms, used the Italian word ""spada"" for his sword, which was a two-handed longsword, in his treatise on knightly martial arts. Hundreds of years later, 17th century master Ridolfo Capo Ferro used the same word ""spada"" to refer to a long, one-handed sword with a complex hilt designed mainly for the thrust - what we would probably call a ""rapier"". 
 To complicate matters even more, the 16th century German master Joachim Meyer used the word ""rappier"" to describe a one-handed cut-and-thrust sword, which would be called a ""sidesword"" by modern HEMA practitioners, based on the Italian term ""spade de lato"". But Italian masters that taught the use of this weapon, like Achille Marozzo and Giovanni dall'Aggochie simply call this weapon a ""spada"". 
 So how does this relate to the question at hand? Well, basically, there were certain swords, sometimes called ""military rapiers"" by modern people, which were used on the battlefield. If your definition of what a ""rapier"" is can accept those weapons (a bit more like cut-and-thrust swords and less like the thrust-optimised ""rapier"" we're familiar with) as rapiers, then yes, rapiers have been deployed in more regimented battles. 
 So now we have established that for some definitions of ""rapier"", the weapon did appear on the battlefield. But how effective are they? Now here's the kicker: throughout human history, swords were NOT primary weapons on the battlefield, outside of a few notable exceptions (like the Romans). From antiquity through the middle ages, spears were far more common. European knights? They used lances, pollaxes and other polearms. Japanese samurai? They started out as horse archers, and during the Sengoku period the spear was still the weapon of choice in a set-piece battle. Specifically, for the heyday of the rapier, the main battlefield weapons were the pike and early firearms. Personal sidearms like the rapier rarely enter into the equation at all! So was it ever used effectively? I would say no, in that the use of rapiers was never the deciding factor in the outcome of a battle. But then again, that statement can be applied to about 99% of all swords throughout human history, and while it might not have won or lost a battle, its use did control the life and death of certain individual soldiers on the battlefield, but accounts of those fights are rather harder to find.","Depends on what you call a rapier. Some were used in battle, but swords never decided battles anyways.

AskReddit,c6t7xb0,"In July actually!! 
 So, Im a lifeguard at a wave pool at a water park. The way the pool works, the waves are on for ten minutes, then they turn off for ten minutes and all the lifeguards rotate positions one by one, then the waves turn back on. 
 So I was guarding at one of the stands and notice this little 8 year old chinese girl floating on her raft on her back, just sunbathing. I dont really think anything of it, people fall asleep on rafts all the time in the sun, the waves kinda lull people to sleep. 
 So after two rotations I notice shes still on the raft. Again, twenty minutes sleeping in the sun is nothing strange, but it seemed weird to me that a little girl would be so chill, normally theyre bouncing off the walls, right? So when rotation comes for the third time I was bumped off to take my lunch break and happened to mention something offhand to my lead. She seemed to think that I was just looking for an excuse to get wet (It was over a hundred and our umbrellas werent doing shit), but she let me go to check on her anyways (we're best friends, she was just doing me a favor). 
 So I grabbed a tube and swam out to her, not even fast. I was honestly just doing it to cool off. People sleeping for over an hour is nothing if not common. 
 So I get to her, and I do the whole ""Checky-Checky are you okay?"" and her head rolls to the side and vomit fucking runs out of her mouth. So I freak the fuck out, pull her off the raft and onto my tube, put my fist in the air and blow two long blows (one long blow is a signal forty, two long blows is an emergency). 
 I put my seal-easy to her mouth and start doing in water rescue breathing to get her to the side and my lead and supe jump in to help me kick her over (it's a giant pool). 
 When we get her to the side to pull her out she opens her eyes and stared right the fuck at me. Legit the most chilling thing ever, I felt like time stopped and that I stared at her forever. I feel like part of me will always be in the pool making eye contact with a frightened little girl on vacation. 
 Long story short, she ended up being okay. Turns out seizures run in her family but shed never had one. The doctors said that some seizures make your whole body shake, but others, like the one she had, dont. Theyre called petit (I only remember that cause of French ;).

 My girlfriend when i met her had a 1 year old and now we have forged a strong relationship and he is 4 now and I'm ""Dad"" (the father is not around). I have been a father to this child, although i feel like sometimes i have taken a back seat. 
 I love MY little man to bits, and to be honest i have so many fun times with him that it is SO all worth it. 
 But what i have come here to say is probably (hopefully) what most parents feel -  In that i am sometimes angry with him, for restricting my life and being a disobedient mofo. Its difficult raising a child and putting them before yourself when working 9 hours a day at 26. I think this is possibly because he is not my child, and i think it will be difficult for us when we do have kids together (which we do want to do in a few years time). 
 i think i get upset with him when he is disobedient, which is normally down to me spending too little QUALITY time with him. 
 What i would say to any stepfathers is that if it makes you happy looking after the child more that it upsets/stress's you then it is a positive thing in your life, and that can only be good. However being a stepfather is a two way road where you will instantly be given happiness from that fact that you are not pretending to be that guy.  You have to be that guy, the man we all aspire to be.  Sometimes that means sacrificing your wants, and that can be upsetting, but its a good in the long run

If there is one thing i have learnt it is that it is so important so spend QUALITY time with my son. He is so much more happy for it and is not angry when i ask thing's of him.

It was senior year of high school, around this time of year. My two friends and I went to a mutual friend's house for a sleepover.

So, we helped ourselves by mixing it with various drinks and sat around a bonfire in the backyard while her parents were away at a Christmas party with all their coworkers (they are teachers, this is relevant later). 
Soon, one of my friends pulled out her bowl, started to pack it, and asked if I wanted to try it. I was at least buzzed at this point, so I thought, fuck it, I'll do it.

AskReddit,ca0rkb7,"Life is very simple - but it isn't easy. 
 Start exercising every morning, first thing, before breakfast. Wake up an hour early to do so.  Walking, situps, and pushups are simple, free, and you can do them anywhere.  You have no excuse to not have space, or time or a gym.  If you are sore, or tired, take one or two days off.  But no more than two!  Don’t go more than two days without exercising. 
 Pay attention to what you eat, including portion size. More fruits and vegetables, smaller helpings of meats and pastas, single servings of fats and sugars, watch your salt intake.  Look at the label, see what “one serving size” is, and eat only that amount.  (Keep nuts, beef jerky, and dried fruit in the cupboard for snacks, ones without added sugar or salt.). 
 Whatever you eat for meals or snacks, don’t eat it out of the bag or container.  It’s a lot easier to stick to reasonable portion size if you put a few nuts, dried fruits, and pieces of beef jerky on a plate than if you pull all three bags onto the couch in front of the TV.  This holds true for treats, also – help yourself to ice cream or candies, but limit your portion sizes, and put them away before you start eating. 
 Drink more water.  If you are hungry, have a glass of water first, and see if you are still hungry.  Your brain sometimes misinterprets thirst as hunger.  Keep hydrated – your urine should look like lemonade, not apple juice. 
 Why are you so stressed?  Take a deep breath, and let it out slowly.  Breathe.  Relax.  Take ten minutes and put your worries aside.  Take a break.  Stretch your tight muscles, maybe clench and relax them in sequence.  If you spend time on the computer, stretch your wrists and forearms; give your eyes a rest.  Check your posture.  Get a massage, or take a walk along a river/park without your cell phone.  Take care of your mental and emotional health, it’s just as important as your physical health, and needs just as much attention and work. 
 Spend your winter/spring in both high school and college securing a job, internship, or full time volunteer position for the summer, even if it is unpaid. The experience will be worth it, especially the references and letters of recommendation. Use these summers to try new things, or to gain experience doing grunt work in the field you want to go into.  (These positions are sometimes ONLY available to current students, not after you graduate.  Take advantage!) 
 If/when you are not a student, do the same thing.  Spend evenings and weekends finding a better job to apply for, or learning new skills, or volunteering in something related to the position you want.  If you are trapped in a shitty job or situation, it is your fault, and you can break out of it, but YOU have to do the work and put in the effort.  No one is going to give you a handout or an opportunity out of the blue unless you make it happen 
 Get a bank account, or a second one if you have one. Set up automatic transfers, and put a small amount in every month. Even five dollars per month is worth it, just meet the minimum so the account has no fees. Hoard the money in this account, and use it only for emergencies (medical expenses, getting laid off, car broke down, etc.). 
 Feel free to use credit cards, but treat them identically to cash. Pay the balance IN FULL every month. Zero your entire statement. Same with any loan you receive, be it student loans or a mortgage or car financing. Read the terms carefully. Understand that YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS MONEY BACK. It is not yours. You are not entitled to it. 
 If you have any other bills or debts, pay them off in full, or set up a payment plan, RIGHT AWAY. Plan and live your life to never have such debts ever again, to build savings and retirement funds. 
 Get health insurance.  Use it.  If you’re injured, get evaluated.  Get a physical if you haven’t had one in a long time, find a primary physician you trust.  Ask questions – always bring a list of questions or concerns with you when you go to the doctor, and take notes on anything they tell you.  Get copies of any test results or imaging studies, and keep them in a safe place. 
 Buy new clothes more often, you slob. Make sure your old ones still fit CORRECTLY, or give them away. (But buy them cheaply at one of those bargain/discount type stores!)  Take care of your hygiene and appearance.  You’ll feel better, and people will treat you better. 
 Find ways to learn social skills. Dance classes, see a therapist, leadership seminars, business training, politics, museums, whatever works for you. These will help you in your personal and professional life, from everything from getting a raise, acing a job interview, and yes, doing that cutie you keep staring at. 
 Speaking of dating, just ask him/her out. Worst-case scenario he/she says no, and you move on, no longer obsessing or wondering. But treat him/her like a PERSON, not an object. Get to know them, respect them, and empathize with them. Do this to anyone you want to like you, or that you care about. Tell them, and show them that you care - don’t assume they know, or that they should figure it out.  Tell them and show them they matter to you. 
 Watch some comedians and sitcoms.  Pay attention to how they speak and move.  Their body language, tone of voice, posture, pacing, timing, etc.  Mimic or imitate these aspects.  You’ll come across to people as clever, witty, and interesting.  Beware of plagiarizing their jokes, though! 
 Nothing comes to you without hard work. You have to put in the effort, whether it is to lose weight, get healthy, become an athlete, get a date, change your job, make money, and even be happy. Yes, being happy is a choice, and you have to work at it. 
 Lastly, never insult the people around you. Especially the people who make the food. Get to know the janitors, secretaries, delivery people, and other invisible and unthanked people that you see regularly. Learn their names, at the very least. One day, they will be there for you to open a door when you REALLY need it. Literally, in the case of the janitor. 
 
 Reread this list.  (I bet you’ve already forgotten the fifth piece of advice, haven’t you?).  Google ways to do anything on this list, or just ask.  I can point you to resources that helped me with many of them, but you have to find WHAT WORKS FOR YOU.  Listen to your body, pay attention to your life, put in the time to make yourself happy.  No one will do it but you, and you have to start now.","Love what you do, and put in the effort. It's never too late to make that necessary change, nor too early to start. Get into good habits early, and stick with them. 
 If you need help with any of the above, just ask.  Ask a friend, a loved one, an advisor.  Call a free hotline for advice.  Find an internet forum or subreddit.  Hell, even ask me.  Consult a lawyer, financial advisor, doctor, whatever.  But do your own research as well, and put in the time and effort towards your goals."
AskReddit,c25v1hh,"I lived next to a farm and my neighbor(from the city) would ask me for help for little or no pay once a week or so. He had suffered a stroke before moving to the country and had a hard time moving around. I did a many fucked up things for him just because I thought it was the right thing to do as a neighbor and I'm a big softy. 
 One of the worse experiences was after one of his cows had given birth. Sometimes the birth will either break the mothers hips or pinch a nerve that temporarily paralyses the rear legs. He didn't want to lose this cow, as they were like pets to him and we would feed, water and clean up after her. I even arranged for someone I knew to bring in a lift to try to relieve pressure on the nerve and reset her hips. It was weeks before he finally took everyone's advise and put her down. So the day that he was going to take care of it I come home from school and he is sitting on my porch with a gun. He can't do it and wanted me to. He tells me to place the shot on the flat spot of the forehead, which I would later find out was the wrong place. 
 I had to drag her with a tractor to a hole he dug and then proceed to shoot her in the thickest part of the skull with a under powered rifle. I shot at least 8-10 times with a single shot 22. It scarred me very badly. I cried as I pushed the dirt pile back over her. 
 The farmer that gave him instructions told me later that he had warned him not to shoot her in that location because it wouldn't kill her immediately.",Had to shoot a cow after taking care of it for weeks. Not my cow and no pay.
AskReddit,c2x0hp9,"I got my first ""big girl"" job after graduating college this August teaching highschool. My previous job was stripping, so I was used to staying out all night and just getting hammered every night. So, I was quite proud of myself for not drinking for three weeks, sleeping, and getting to work on time for the first month of work. 
 Anyway, my friends decided for me I was long overdue for some drunken debauchery, so needless to say, I got shithouse hammered. I got on the bar at a bar that the GM of the strip club I used to work at owns. There was enough chanting for me to get naked and I was drunk enough to attempt it. With my pants halfway around my ass I fell face first off the bar and landed on my eye socket. 
 My friend is an RN and knew enough to take care of me until we got to the hospital. I broke my [frontal bone]( and my [maxilla]( After throwing up all over her BMW and her friend, we got to the ER I was put in a bed. Decided that I just HAD to shit. So, three nurses held my drunkass up while I proceeded to do the do on what was essentially a toilet seat with a plastic grocery bag hanging in the center. Then said nurses had to wipe my ass for me. I passed out somewhere around this point and woke up in an MRI machine. Passed out again. Woke up in xray. Passed out again. Woke up on my couch. Passed out again and it was 36 hours later. The beauty of hydrocodone. 
 My right eye didn't rotate up and to the right without a massive force of effort and then it involuntarily would 
point inwards when I tried. It's been a few months and now it's better, but I may still have to have surgery on it. 
 Anyway... that's how one night at the bar will potentially cost me around $10,000 :D","Drunk, stripping on a bar, face planted, broke my eye socket"

I thought wow that's cool looking. I asked him how he did that. He showed me that he was holding a .22 caliber bullet in one hand and hitting it with the hammer to explode the blocks. It looked like some serious fun. I tried it of course I blew up one brick that was fun! The second time I did it I got skittish and let go of the bullet when the hammer was about to hit it. So I hit the bullet while it was at an angle it destroyed a corner of the brick, and I felt my right leg jerk and feel like something had hit it. I did up and backed away assuming that it was a chunk of brick. Then I realized that it could have been the bullet. I looked down and saw a neat perfect little hole in my calf. I freaked out and started to go into shock. At the hospital they take a pair of large forceps and dig around in the hole after an x-ray. That was the worst part.

AskReddit,cbrd8rj,"I live in a pretty cool beach house with a detached garage that we turned into a bar/hangout complete with full size bar, couch, TV, etc. When I first moved in I would routinely have people over to watch sports or just drink/smoke and hang out. During one of these times, I had the girl I liked at the time over and it seemed like things were going pretty well, except for the friend of a friend who came over and was also trying to go after the same girl. 
 It's getting later in the night, and this guy is trying way too hard but I can't tell if she's into it or not. I take a rip from the bong then leave to go take a piss and while I'm in my house I hear glass break. I don't think much of it until I walk out and everyone's quiet. I see broken glass everywhere and an empty space on the bar where I had just set the bong not 10 minutes before. 
 Not a big deal, it's just a bong right? It was my new roommate's brother's bong, one of the original Illadelph styles that came out a long time ago when they first started. My roommate had just brought it out of storage and told me to feel free to use it as my own, it just needed a new stem. I spent about $80 on a downstem as well as a showerhead. The bong alone was $450+ new, but closer to $550 with what I spent. 
 The guy didn't smoke weed and was just trying to show off to the girl how my bar lifted up at the end. Genius didn't think to move the bong first and lifted it right onto the floor. After a while of even trying to find where I could replace this custom glass (because roommate's brother was coming back from a two-year stint in Panama in a month), the guy said he had never intended to pay for the replacement and that he'd give me $120 towards a new one. I was eventually able to get that up to $180, but I had to cover the difference. 
 Around the same time my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and I had just saved enough money to fly home to visit him for the first time since we found out. I ended up having to spend that money on the new bong because I didn't want to piss off my new roommate. I never told the guy about that and for the first few months after when I'd run into him he'd always make comments about it. Finally one time just to be nice I told him not to feel too bad and he said, ""I don't feel bad at all, I paid for it."" 
 I also lost a custom bubbler I had bought about 5 weeks prior earlier in the evening and told the guy who broke THAT not to worry about it because I had just been gifted this bong to smoke out of. Such is life.","Friend of a friend breaks a rare, valuable bong ($450+) at my house while trying to hit on the girl I was going after at the time. Refuses to pay more than $180 for the replacement.

AskReddit,c3gtg9f,"I know this is probably never going to be seen, but all these stories just reminded me of a story I have when I was a little kid. 
 I was probably 11-12 years old at the time. My group of friends consisted of the kids who lived on my street. Some might considered we lived in the ""ghetto."" At the end of our street there was this old broken down house, colored dark green. It has been abandoned for years and I have never seen one soul come in or out the house. The paint was chipping, shingles were falling off, the grass was always long. My friends and I use to pass by this house everyday, walking to and from school. 
 One day, while walking by from school, a friend dared me to knock on the door. Me being hormone raged and wanting to impress the girls on my street, I agreed. My plan was to knock and run. I started walking towards the porch as my friends were watching me from the front of the yard. I reach the door and I could hear every creak, whenever I took a step. For some forsaken reason my hand starts to go towards the knob (instead of just knocking and running). I twist the knob all the way and realized it was unlocked. I got really scared and ran back to the group, telling them what I witnessed. 
 We agreed to meet up later that night and try to go in. That night, only me, and my two friends Ben and Justin met up. The others, I'm guessing were too scared or couldn't sneak out. At this time, it is pitch black outside. We have a couple of flashlights and some sticks for protection. We began to sneak our way to the front door. We are still for sure scared shitless. I began to turn the knob of the door, and what I see next I will never forget. 
 We open the door and turn our flash lights on.  Everything in the house is fucking spotless and clean.  All the furniture looked like it was from the 1900's, but almost looked brand new. You couldn't possibly imagine how the inside of this house looked, by the exterior of it. There was a light coming from the upstairs so we were able to see everything downstairs, except certain rooms (the kitchen, the second living room). I had the weirdest feeling in my gut, but I couldn't move, but I wasn't scared. It was just a mix of emotions. For some reason we didn't look around or anything. We just followed the light upstairs. I'm still mixed with emotions but our sticks made me feel somewhat comfort. When we reach the upstairs hallway I see a room with light streaking out from the bottom. We slowly walk up to it and open the door. The room has a single light hanging from the middle of the room and the whole room, (walls, floor, ceiling) was painted red. 
 I really do not remember what happen next except me running out and there were my hillbilly neighbors out there. They called the police and I had to explain to them what happen. They looked into the house and said everything was trashed. There was no furniture and only old carpet, and papers lying around. Our parents got involved and shit just became all a blur. I didn't go outside for a month. I got driven to school from now on. A couple weeks later I remember driving by the house and everything is boarded up. The door, the windows, there was caution tape hanging on the porch. There was even a yellow ""CONDEMNED"" warning on the door. I was really confused. 
 A few years later I found out that there had been a girl who had been raped in that house. The people who did it (thought they killed her) and locked her up in the upstairs room. She ended up killing herself and the whole room was covered in her blood. I get chills thinking about it.","broke into a house with some friends, found a room where a girl was raped and died at."
AskReddit,cbk50bs,"I worked in a hotel restaurant that was just awful. Seriously, I don't think anyone really gives those who work there the respect/tip they deserve- often times, we were thought of as employees of the hotel, not waiters.

 One time, though, we had a guest who came on the weekend and then stayed until Monday. Now on the weekend, we had the ""special"" buffet, which included bacon. The guest demanded to know why on Mondays, we didn't have bacon, nor could we make him a special order.

 This is a case of not having to cheat. In college, a friend and I decided to skip our Diff Equations class because we thought we were just reviewing for the test. This was a Friday before spring break, so we assumed the test was the Monday after break. So we get back from break and the professor hands the tests back to everyone (apparently they actually took the test the day we skipped). The prof realizes he didn't hand ours back and says he probably forgot them in his office so he would give them back to the two of us the next day. So instead of admitting we didn't take the test, we just go along with it. 
 Next day in class, prof walks in visibly upset. He admits that he must have lost our test and to speak with him after class about the situation.

 So, basically, the day came and I had no idea that would be the day. We were going to a concert, and before then, we were just sitting around in the park. It was dark already, and we were sitting side by side.
so when she leaned over, I thought she was just kissing my cheek, so I kind of pushed my cheek to her. But she continued to go for lips, and I had my first kiss. I wish I could say it was amazing.

I did not know what I was doing, and clearly i was doing it wrong because we were making out, but it seemed like I was kissing AROUND her mouth. Then after a few seconds, I was like, oh fuck I am absolutely ruining this moment because i'm so bad at kissing, then I just BURST out laughing and giggling like a little girl.

AskReddit,c0hi4cz,"OK, I'm dumb. 
 You're suggesting: ""I don't know the difference between correlation and causation; therefore, I am dumb."" 
 Just because lots of people who are dumb don't know that difference, it isn't that lack of knowledge that makes them dumb; indeed, learning that difference won't make them smart.  There are any number of circumstantial factors which could prevent a smart person from knowing the difference between correlation and causation: lack of education, having it explained poorly first by someone else, simply having not thought about it much, etc.  In fact, your desire to learn the difference implies some intelligence on your part, wang-banger. 
 To wrap up, even though most dumb people don't know the difference between correlation and causation, and most smart people do know it, knowing the difference doesn't  make  someone smart or dumb; it's just that smart people are more  inclined  (and, to some degree,  able ) to know it.  Intelligence is the result of brain structure, experience, and the like; we know  these  are its causes because their direct and measurable effects are precisely those acts which we deem intelligent,  and --the ""and"" is crucial--the performance of acts which we deem unintelligent stems precisely from a lack of these factors, such that increasing those factors increases intelligence.",You're so dumb you don't know how to know you're dumb.

AskReddit,c82scn2,"I was in an ambulance carrying me from the hospital in small provincial town towards the big hospital in the capital. I had bad pneumonia which was not responding well to (weak, old and not very effective) oral antibiotics doctors were giving me. In the ambulance I was choking, unable to breathe from (what was later found to be) 750 grams of fluids accumulated in my lungs. The ambulance was jolting, I was short of breath, and next thing I remember was I felt SEVERE blow that kicked me out of my body. I later read stories by other people in similar near dead situations who reported seeing a tunnel and a light, but this was not what I experienced. It was just a blow, a kick which threw me out of my body. I was looking at my body from the side, and also seeing a medical sister which was trying to put a breathing mask on my face. 
 At first I thought that something happened with my vision and I panicked. I was seeing everything in 2D, like on a movie screen, and also nearly black and white. It was not completely black and white, it was like the colors were very darkened, as if everything was a shades of gray with very little color in it. I know that this seems strange, I mean, I looked at my body from the side and yet I panicked for my eyes and vision, but that was what I thought then. I was 14 year old at the time, and in a state of panic, and I guess my logic was weak and weird at this moment. I severely panicked for my eyes and vision and that was a moment when I thought of my mother, and in an instant, I was looking at her. 
 She was traveling together with my father and my uncle in a car following the ambulance on a road to the capital. It was my uncle's car. I started talking to my mother, telling her that my eyes are not ok, that something happened to my eyes and I cannot see well. She did not heard me. They continued to talk, cursing and lambasting the incompetent doctors at provincial hospital, discussing how those doctors tried to coax them to sign some papers after the ambulance left, how they refused to sign, and how they arranged for me to be admitted in the department led by an experienced and very competent doctor with strange name (assoc. prof. Koiundurliev). This was unique name which I remembered. 
 At that point the gravity of situation hit me. I finally realized that something weird happened, that I shall not be in this car, and I panicked even more. I began to think of my friends at school and of the girl I liked, and as soon as thought of someone was really ""sharp enough"" in my mind (I don't know how to explain this in writing), but as soon as thought about someone was ""sharp enough"" I instantly saw them as if I was standing next to that person in this very moment. Then the panic hit me even harder, I started jumping from place to place, from memory to memory, in an ever increasing pace, and everything became a kaleidoscope of people and places. 
 This jumping from place to place abruptly stopped when an old lady came. She was very old, with a white hair, white like completely snow white, not white like the grey shadows of other colors I was seeing. She took me by the hand, insisted that I looked at her and repeated several times that I should calm down my mind so that this random jumping from place to place stops. I realized that she was somehow helping me to remain calm, to look only at her and to set at rest and be quiet. 
 Then she proceeded to explain that now I am going to fall asleep, and when I wake up I will be at the hospital. She told me that doctors will start giving me injections, that some of them will be painful, but I shall be brave like a man and endure the pain, and that my condition is going to improve. But after two months doctors will propose a surgery. She insisted, several times, that immediately when I wake up I MUST tell my mother to refuse to sign papers for the surgery, to refuse to let them do the surgery. She told me that if they do the surgery I am going to die, and insisted again, several times, that I should explain this to my mother as soon as I wake up. She also told me that if I am a good boy and do as she told me to do, my uncle is going to bring me a lot of delicious chocolates in the hospital. 
 So, long story short: I woke up at the ER, told everything to my mother, she was shocked by my detailed description of what they talked about in the car, I distinctly remember her eyes grew WIDE OPEN when I told her the strange name of the doctor, and she listened to my frenetical demands from her to refuse to sign the papers for the surgery. She was not understanding what I am talking about, as at this moment no one was talking about any surgery. My mother told me that everything is going to be ok, that there is not going to be any surgery and generally tried to calm me down. 
 I slept a lot in the hospital, was very weak. Doctors drew up the fluids from my lungs using long and thick needles inserted through my back. It was indeed very painful. Christmas came and passed. They gave me strong antibiotic injections and I recovered. 45 days later they saw on X-Rays one particular spot on my left lung which was refusing to heal. Two months later is was still there - still same size. On next X-Ray - again. They proposed a surgery to remove this spot. 
 My mother resisted to them initially, but eventually, as time passed, there were many doctors insisting that surgery must be done, and my mother finally gave in to their pressure and signed the papers. But this delayed the surgery for many weeks, and when they did a final X-Ray before the surgery to see how big the spot is - it was gone, and the planned surgery was canceled. They all (my mother and the doctors) lied to me, my mother was telling me that there is not going to be a surgery, but they were actually secretly preparing to do it. I only later found out what really happened. 
 My mother also told me how she watched, not believing her own eyes, how my extremely stingy uncle was bringing me chocolate after chocolate in the hospital. This happened in a then socialist country (Bulgaria), my uncle was working as a driver of big truck for international transportation and that was where he bought the chocolates. On our country local market those chocolates were EXTREMELY expensive and nowhere to be found. And my uncle was (and is, to some extent, to this day) very stingy bastard. My mother told me that, above all, this particular piece of my story convinced her to refuse signing surgery papers for so long, despite the intense pressure from the doctors. 
 I have a lot of other weird memories from these events, but I decided to not share them, as I am not sure how reliable my memories are. I am only talking about memories I was able to successfully verify with my relatives. Years later I made my mother and father and uncle tell what they remembered, I recorded their words on tape, and I drew the line around what I consider to be the reliable part of the story and what may be the distortions of my memory from the time passed.

What I do know is that the people who send out the orders do not do so randomly and I have to trust their judgement because i don't know what will happen otherwise.

 Before ending up in the hospital due to the pneumonia, I spent 3 days in and out of lucidity, where I didnt get out of bed to do more than take a drink, puke it up, and then have a back-door explosion. 
 It got so bad, that during several of these episodes, I just got into the shower, turned it on nice and hot, knelt down, and let whatever demons inside of me that needed to come out, do their thing, and be gone down the drain... did I mention I was miserable? Cause I was. 
 Unfortunately, one of the times I re-gained consciousness, and needed to get into the bathroom, I was unable to get up and out of bed and into the shower or sitting on the toilet before the coughing fit began... I am not talking like oh cough cough cover your mouth and say excuse me coughing here, I am talking the kind that leaves your body shaking, unable to control it, cannot catch your breath, feel like you are choking, about to pass out, full body convulsions coughing fit here. 
 Still in bed, needing to have a round of exorcism pea soup scene diarrhea, and my entire body is compressing itself into a very fetal position, with spasms through my abdomen as I double over onto myself, increasing the pressure in my gut with each cough,... until... 
 Trying to hold my breath so that I wouldnt cough more, and attempting to haul my ass [body, all of me, not just my butt] over to the edge of the bed and attempt to stand up to race into the bathroom, I found out the fun way, that the muscular contractions necessary to remove one's self from the prone position, attempting to sit, to lift one's self from a bed, and the lack of incoming breaths forcing me to take a deep breath that my lungs were not capable of handling at the time, caused the convulsive coughing/doubling over, gut squishing horror to intensify further, and this, coupled with already overwhelming need to shit,.... well... 
 I burned those fucking sheets, once this was all said and done. Thats how I handled it in the end.","Gambled while in severe sickly distress, lost, had a smelly bedding bonfire to hide my shame. >.<"
AskReddit,cbr8b84,"I was at a party where people were telling stories about other people at the party. This one kid apparently had a habit when he was drinking where he threw up very easily. Now this was no ordinary ""oh shit better head to the bathroom"" puking this kid did, not even close. What he does do is throw up wherever it was he was standing or sitting. 
 People that were around the room had heard all of the places he had puked before. There was one where he was about to pass out in someones bed then threw up on the floor and cleaned it up with a pillow (cleaning being that he threw a pillow on it and called it good). Another was that he would throw up at a table when playing a card game, ruining the night and the deck of cards. 
 Then the one that applies to myself. While having a party someone thought it would be an ok idea to invite this guy over, because before he threw up he was a funny guy.

AskReddit,cflnbwy,"When I was two years old, my mother decided to enroll me in the preschool that my older brother was going to early. My brother had entered when he was three, my mom decided that she would enter me a year earlier at two - which was the youngest that the school would allow - to see how it would go. 
 She takes me over there, and we pull up to the school, which was combined with a church. So we come up to this small little cottage that looks straight out of a 17th century colonial village, and after knocking on the door, an old, plump, nice looking woman answers. We walk in, and my mom sets me down on the floor and tells me to go play. My mom and the old lady started talking about something that I didn't understand, and I begin to look around this strange looking room. What caught my eye was a boy my age playing with a yellow toy truck. He looked like he was having fun, and I wanted to play with him. I turn to ask my mom if I could go play with him, but she was gone. 
 I can't imagine what was going on through my two year old mind, my mom didn't work, so this was the first time I had ever been separated from her. I immediately started wailing. The old lady picked me up, and I was scared of her so I started crying more. After about five seconds of this, my mom comes back in and takes me back. 
 She took me out of the class, and I went back to that preschool a year later; this time eager to get away from my brat of a little brother.","Mom enrolls me in a preschool class at two; when she leaves I cry, she comes back and takes me out."
AskReddit,cphb6gt,"My story is rather long, but I will try to make it as brief as possible.  My friend had a huge passion for making movies, heck, we all did, and we spent most of our high school weekends in my woods or out at someone’s house making short films.  None of them were that amazing, but we loved it. 
 One summer by buddy decided he wanted to propose to his girlfriend.  She loved his films, and supported him, so what better way to propose then through a movie?  The movie was basically a Lord of the Rings type movie.  The film would be called “The Heart of a Warrior.” 
 In the movie my buddy, playing the main character, would have to fight his way through Satan and his demons, portrayed by us, to win the battle for the heart of his lady.  My character was Satan’s right hand demon, named blindness.  My character would be in a sort of battle with Brazen, another demon, to defeat the warrior and take the maiden.  Each of our characters would be represented by an animal at various points in the movie, Blindness being a wolf.  My buddy had a husky that we were going to use. 
 Long story short, we had practiced our dark speech for our parts daily, had costumes, cameras, weapons and everything we needed.  I was at a girl’s house and my buddy was coming to pick me up for a movie meeting.  I went outside and sat on the front of her car in the driveway waiting for my friend to come get me.  We were in the middle of nowhere, Ohio.  Her driveway goes up to the road, on the left is a hedge that lines her yard all the way to the driveway.  On the right is a giant tree blocking the light from a safety light on the lightpost so that only about 8 feet of her driveway is lit.  As I sat there, the most massive (four feet tall), demonic, horrific looking wolf slowly walked into the light, stopped, and stared straight into my eyes.  I was frozen solid for about ten seconds.  It then turned its head, and walked behind the hedge where I could no longer see it.  I jumped in the car locked the doors and started calling my friend and the girl whose house I was at.  Neither would answer.  I got brave enough to run to her door and knock on the door so I could come inside.  The door connects to her living room, where her, her mother, father, and sisters were all watching a movie.  I was knocking as furiously and loudly as I possibly could but no one would answer. I could hear the movie, I could hear their remarks to each other.  I knocked for about two minutes until I gave up and ran back to the car.  Finally my buddy answered his phone.  I asked where he was and he said he had been sitting in the driveway for ten minutes.  I started screaming “YOU ARE NOT HERE!”  He started yelling back saying he was and that he had been to this house a hundred times.  After about a minute or so he said, “dude… I am somehow at the wrong house down the road…”  He came to get me, I jumped in his car and we took off.  The girl finally called me back and I asked why she wouldn’t answer the door.  She told me no one had knocked and her phone never rang. 
 To this day I have no idea what that was, or why it happened.  I am a very strong Christian and believe some spiritual warfare was at play, judge me if you want, I know what I saw and it changed me.  We never ended up making the movie because his relationship fell apart, yet somehow, I was glad the entire time because I was terrified to become that demon again.","I was playing a demon in a movie portrayed as a wolf, and saw the most demonic, and horrifying wolf-like creature I have ever seen."

 Put the bird in the oven, then boiled some potatoes on the stove in preparation for roasting them.

 The reason I lersonally dont really find Nick Offerman is whether he is llaying a character or not It has gotten old for me. The humor trope of the absurdly 'murican' manly man has been very present (Team America, Chuck Norris etc) this past decade.

 I really think the humorousness in Ron Swanson is his dialogue and relationships with other people. Rons funny moments for me are the times where his character is interacting with someone like Tom or talking about someone like Andy.

 A similar thing that happened in movie theaters for a bit, but is now banned, was subliminal messaging/advertising there would be one frame of the movie cut out and replaced with a Snickers ad or something, and the theory was that you can't actually perceive the flash of ad because of how short it is.  That is correct, it flashes so quick you don't notice it, but your subconscious would pick up on it and make you crave a Snickers, this kind of subliminal messaging works, (There would be multiple frames spaced out through the movie to keep hammering at you subconscious.) backmasking on the other hand does not work.  What that is, is your words reversed to say other words, a good example of this is ""Another one bites the dust"" played backwards sounds very much like ""It's fun to smoke marijuana"", but our minds do not actually pick up on backmasking so you have no need to worry about it.","Cat is there but the last two frames of the cat are so subtle your eyes don't see the cat at the last part.

 One, you are changing a word which is currently used in a derogatory manner against an oppressed group, to a general derogatory word. Gay used to have a strong negative connotation, but it has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ community to have a neutral/descriptive or even positive connotation. Essentially embracing the slur, saying ""damn right I'm gay!"" This, when initiated and accepted by the oppressed group, brings a sense of empowerment to the word, of shielding yourself in a word used to hurt you. 
 When done the other way around by the group that has famously oppressed gay people, ""faggot"" simply implies that because gay people are bad, ""faggot"" means someone bad. That's why people started using it as a general insult in the first place, because to them, being gay was bad. If anything, it perpetuates the status-quo of acceptable homophobia. 
 Two, it's a word that hurts people. That really, really hurts people. It's a slur. It's attacking people for something they have little to no control over, that has no effect on you. You're not critiquing their skill or the content of their argument, you're belittling them for their already taboo sexuality. Dude, not too long ago some congressmen tried to write a constitutional amendment banning gay people from getting married. Gay people are regularly beaten and killed for their sexuality. More commit suicide because of the constant fucking hatred they get. ""Faggot"" is a representation of this hatred in the form of a word. 
 Are you really so callous and uncaring that you cannot imagine why saying such a word as a general pejorative insult maybe isn't such a good idea? 
 What you are doing is hurting people. Not just what you feel when someone calls you fag on a message board. You honestly cannot fucking imagine how deep that word cuts. So, sure, you can go ahead and ""redefine the word"" but acknowledge that you are intentionally inflicting pain upon others when using it. And this new definition doesn't decrease the word's power. Seriously, go out and find some stranger in person who is gay. Call them faggot, and then explain that the word is everyone's to define. I'm sure they will bow to your obviously superior understanding of linguistics and appropriation.",You  can  try to redefine a word. But to do so means hurting a great many people who have already been hurt far too much by this world. It shows a callousness and lack of empathy. G'day mate.

funny,coqx9eg,"God dammit. This is completely untrue. Not only that, but reddit has no idea how the fuck to use the central limit theorem. It's talked about incorrectly all the fucking time on here, even in /r/science. And it's taught in every intro stats class. So here is what the central limit theorem says, in laymen terms. 
 You have some underlying distribution of some variable X. Doesn't matter what that distribution looks like. Take 100 samples from X. Take the average of those 100 samples. Now repeat  that  many times. The distribution of the  averages  you computed will be normal. 
 Why the fuck would a large number of random samples, from a non-normal distribution, be normal? They wouldn't. That makes zero sense. The more samples you take, the more it will look like the underlying distribution. If you sample the whole population, you have the exact underlying distribution. You're saying that if you sampled the entire population, and the underlying distribution wasn't normal, that your samples would magically appear normal. If you sample the whole population, your samples  are  the underlying distribution. If you assume a normal distribution when it's not even close to normal, then anything you say after is 100% wrong.","Lots of samples != normal distribution.

You would close your eyes and ask a question to the Oracle, then wait a few seconds.  When you opened your eyes, the first Engrish t-shirt you saw was the Oracle's answer to your question.  Sometimes the answer was direct and simple:  you close your eyes and ask, ""will I get lucky at this party tonight?""  ...

She gazed into his eyes (aggressive behaviour for gorillas) smiled at him when he smiled back (non submissive behaviour) and frustrated Bokito by teasing him by leaving after she got his attention. 
 After a few weeks/months Bokito had enough. He is an impressively big silverback and managed to jump over the moat surrounding the outside enclosure.

funny,c8o9rda,"To me, its not even about hope. At least, it doesn't require hope. 
 It will get there on it's own. More than anything, it's just unfortunate that we have to keep having this discussion over and over about social issues like this. 
 I really hold no misogynistic tendencies, nor ire toward the feminist movement. I have problems with people based on their actions alone, not on whom they claim to represent. I'll make a dirty sexist joke from time to time, or say something misogynistic in a tongue in cheek way, and sometimes I complain about stuff my girlfriend, and by extension (:D) women do, and that's never really meant with any action anger, and it's just an amusing observation. She does the same thing to me, accusing all men of not properly understanding the proper binary state of the toilet seat. 
 I think these kinds of jokes have an important place in society. If we're not able to joke about our differences, we'll be forever afraid to discuss them at all, for fear of insulting someone. We need to dispel this air of paranoia between race, gender, sexuality, and make it okay to make fun of each other and ourselves again. 
 I have black, asian, jewish, arabic friends, and we all make jokes about each other's ethnicity, and I have gay friends who we make gay jokes about to their face. We can get away with this because we have a mutual understanding that not only are these jokes funny, but that we don't NEED to be offended by them. I've used the fact that i'm white as an excuse plenty of times. 
 Ultimately my problem is with anybody who seeks to drive divisiveness. Feminism won't make ground by trying to inhibit men or gain an unfair advantage over them, and Feminism needs men in order to succeed. Civil equality movements should be inclusive at every turn. 
 LGBT functions this way. They're inclusive. They're not trying to inhibit the rights or freedoms of heterosexual people, and they've swung public opinion in their favor by taking an approach of self-empowerment. They don't focus on persecution, they stick to their message of saying that we are the same as you, and we deserve to be treated the same as everybody else. 
 My point is not that Feminism functions against this method. I'm again strictly talking about the people who would promote the superiority of one gender over the other. People who don't think the way you do. People who only masquerade as feminists. 
 At any rate, like I said. It doesn't require hope, because modern history has gradually and unsteadily shown that we are in a time of progressivism. These things, LGBT rights, Racial equality, Gender equality, they feel right to us as a society in the first world, and we know we're stronger together. The people who fight it are afraid of the changes, or they don't identify with the cause. This usually isn't ACTUALLY their fault, and there are fewer and fewer of them each year. We'll get where we want to be eventually as long as people keep fighting the good fight, and not the easy fight. 
 All that said, I actually AM very hopeful. 
 Edit: apologize for wall of text.","I don't need to be hopeful because the core of feminism is inclusive and people will respond to that, and we'll get where we need to be because modern society is increasingly progressive. I do have hope, though. Thanks."

funny,cglvj0x,"I'm a professional trumpeter, having been asked to play for free many times, I've had lots of opportunities to contemplate this situation. The problem with these ads is much more than simply the insult of not respecting live music enough to pay for it. These ""venues"" are actually destroying the music scene of their communities. Hear me out... 
 First of all, let's get rid of the idea that they are offering any kind of useful exposure or promotional value. Music fans don't go to restaurants to discover new music and buy CDs. They go to music venues to do that. Is this restaurant a respected music venue? Unlikely, since those places are typically willing to pay something to get groups that will draw a crowd (also, if they were, they'd mention it in the ad). Is this restaurant trying to become a respected music venue? Definitely not. If they were, they wouldn't be asking for free music from Craigslist, they'd be trying to book big (at least locally big) name groups to give themselves some credibility in the music community. So, if they're not a venue, and not trying to become a venue, what kind of ""exposure"" are they offering? ""Hey, maybe a bride-to-be will come in and will hire you to play her wedding next year because she loves how your music complements her spinach artichoke dip!"" Because, that's how that works, right?!? No. No, it isn't. 
 Now, assuming they don't have an aspiration to become a music spot, let's think about why they're adding music. For ambiance right? Well, that's what they say, but there's a catch. What the ad doesn't tell you, but I guarantee is a part of the ""agreement,"" is that the band is expected to bring in patrons. It's not, ""hey, come play here and sell your cd!"" It's actually, ""hey, come play here, and bring 20-30 of your friends and family to drink $8 beers and eat $12 jalapeno poppers! We're still not paying you..."" 
 This is where the destruction of the local music scene happens. 
 The only actual benefit these gigs provide, is that some young groups will get better after playing a lot of gigs. But most bands can only get their friends and family to come out to hear them 3 or 4 times, then everyone mysteriously can't make it. ""Sorry, bro!"" The restaurant loves these first dates, but after a couple of gigs where the band doesn't bring enough of their fans, they won't book them anymore and they'll start over with another crap band with a new group of fans. Sadly, these young bands don't have the chance to play enough dates to get good in front of a crowd, so they just continue to be really mediocre, or even bad. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that someone went into that restaurant, heard that lame band, and decided ""ugh, I hate jazz!"" (or indie rock, or klezmer, or whatever) So now they'll never go check out the GREAT group playing at the cool venue around the corner. See, it's REALLY hard to get good at performing and someone who isn't aware of what they're listening to (a young group that's trying to find it's voice, perhaps, but maybe just some hacks who decided it'd be cool to dust off the guitar from the back of the closet) will often write off an entire genre of music because they don't realize the group they're hearing isn't made up of professionals, who have the experience, taste, and passion to create a high quality product. It's like people who decide ""classical music is boring,"" but never heard any group better than their high school orchestra. Go listen (live) to the Chicago Symphony play Mahler 5, or the New York Phil play Rite of Spring, or the Cleveland Orchestra play Pictures at an Exhibition, or something similar, THEN decide if you think classical music is boring. 
 Live music is powerful. Live music can move people in a way that nothing else can. We need to support it in our communities, but these places devalue it and actually drive people away from it. I know it sounds hyperbolic, but they're actively eroding their music community. Fuck them.","This place isn't paying for experienced musicians and will not (don't try to argue that they ""might,"" they won't) provide a place for young musicians to grow as artists.

 I suppose I've always got the option of contacts (which again, the price adds up for) or vision correction (which wouldn't correct all of my vision problems, so there's no point), but I've worn glasses since I was 2 or 3 (almost 20 years ago) and (to me) they're as defining a point about my face as your nose is on yours, so If I have to choose between two expensive options, I'll take the one I'm used to thanks!

You get treated differently. I'm 20 now but in highschool i was bullied mercilessly all the time, particularly in the first years. (highschool is grades 7-12 in Aus) the strange thing is that people here all tend to view redheads as fair game. I would not call hatred towards redheads racist but it is certainly bigotry and prejudice. 
 In 9th grade i was once falsely accused of calling another student 'black' and suddenly half the school fucking hated me for two weeks till I was able to convince most people that he made it up as an excuse to fight me.

funny,c5qe4mu,"I think the majority reason for not accepting evidence of alien UFOs is the lack of solid physical verifiable evidence. Eyewitness accounts, grainy footage, and knowledge of government aviation experimentation makes it difficult to accept an explanation outside of what we can understand with simpler explanations than alien visitors. 
 Even when a real witness (non hoax) is sure of what they saw, there are many reasons it could be something other than an alien UFO. As stated before, it could be an experimental government craft, or any number of things that can compromise the ""reality"" of what they saw (any number of tricks the brain can do). 
 That all being said. I have to put in that as skeptical as I am, putting evidence as the main key for people to believe... A few years ago in San Diego, I too saw something far in the distant sky one day (a white object, maybe saucer/cigar shaped, but it was so away far best i could describe it is to say it was a white line), zipping around in all directions very quickly (it was hard to keep track of it between clouds, its movement when I would look away, and the distance it was from me). I know of no aircraft or bird that could have moved that way. It was fast, it left no con trails, could suspend itself, and move all directions. 
 And while I know I saw this... I don't present it as evidence for a ""UFO"" (in the vernacular sense denoting alien craft, it was certainly an ""unidentified flying object"" to myself). I took no photos or video (and even if I did the video quality do it its distance would have been little proof of anything). I have heard of sightings from trusted friends and family, and I have no reason to disbelieve their belief. But I remain skeptical... 
 There are always ""other"" explanations, seeing is not always believing. Until we have any real solid verifiable evidence, the scientific community must explore the concept while remaining skeptical. And if there is truth to alien visitors, governments usually have good reasons to not incite a panic by making it public information. 
 Edit: Also, none of this is to say that we should be skeptical of life outside of earth. Statistically that is almost certain. But the timescale of the universe and difficulty of traveling such distances in space with modernly understood physics makes visitor claims tough to accept sometimes. The logistics involved with traveling in such ways means manipulating space-time, and in that vein, ""alien UFOs"" are just as likely ""time traveling UFOs"" from our own future. But until we can verify any of the claims, we can only guess, dream, and hope of peaceful contact with another intelligent planet some day.",Skeptical review of presentable evidence is more important to understanding astounding claims than eyewitness accounts.

 Let me use the example of Hitler and Osama bin Laden. Both were charismatic leaders, both did horrible things, both were fucked over by elements out of their control. 
 In the case of Hitler, it was WWI and the Treaty of Versailles. 
 In the case of Osama bin Laden, it was his involvement in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the Cold War, and the subsequent installation of a puppet gov by the US. 
 I'm not saying the case for cycles in history is perfect, but just stick with me for a couple more paragraphs. 
 Both were leaders that grew out of grassroots movements, being the product of being screwed. Hitler, being a soldier in WWI, and seeing Germany ripped apart by the incredible war reparations that were put on it. Osama, was the leader of Al Qaeda, and his group was promised control of Afghanistan after the invasion, along with two other factions, by the US in its attempt to contain Communism. 
 Hitler watched his people endure the withered economy of Germany, and be became the madman we know today. Osama got screwed out of a country, while a pro-Christian group was put in power by the US, they didn't last long in a resulting civil war, and here is where we see the rise of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Middle East, and, in turn, (if you believe that swiss cheese story of inconsistent facts) 9/11.

Sex takes a  lot  more effort than masturbation does. Instead of just worrying about getting yourself off, you also have to worry about your partner, and how they're doing, and their emotional needs and whatnot. It's not that that's a problem all the time, just that it's not something that everyone wants to go through every time that they're horny. Since you say that you're still having sex two or three times a week though, it sounds like your boyfriend is just at his limit for how many times he wants to deal with the whole process of sex per week (two to three times a week is average for many people). 
 That being said, I don't think your boyfriend should just be let off the hook, either. Just because he doesn't want sex any more than three times a week doesn't mean that he shouldn't have more sex with you anyways.

funny,c2buyig,"Why is it that women are incapable of knowing when they're really drunk and slowing down/ STOPPING? 
 Ah, well thats the thing. Once you are really drunk you are not really aware enough to know its a good idea to stop. The trick is to stop before you hit that stage. 
This is where being a woman makes it more difficult. If you are an average male, you will have more muscle mass, probably more mass in general, a larger liver, and also are much much more likely to have eaten before you went out (girls will often choose for outfit reasons not to eat much before going out clubbing, or for eating disorder reasons). This means that you will drink, say, 4 pints and be a bit tipsy. You will drink 5 pints, and be drunk, and will then say ""ok, i'll stop drinking now"". If you then have a sixth pint, you will get to that stage of drunk where you forget the consequences. So, it's easy enough to stop on the 5th pint, instead of having the sixth. 
On the other hand, if you are a 110 pound girl who hasn't eaten all day, you have the first drink and you are mildly tipsy. You have the second, and you are already in the too drunk stage. It took me till I was about 22 to realise that actually it is fine to leave 3/4 of a drink undrunk. Years of parents saying you must finish your dinner really leave a mark (on obesity as well as drinking habits). 
 |It's always baffled me that if a woman gets drunk and decides to drive home and kills someone, she's held fully accountable for her actions - yet if she gets drunk and decides to sleep with someone then she's somehow absolved of all responsibility for her actions 
 See, the issue here is the levels of drunk required. If you are driving drunk, in the majority of cases you are probably only a bit tipsy. You won't feel that drunk but its enough to majorly impact on driving reactions.
However, to cheat on your boyfriend just because you were drunk probably means you are far far drunker than that. On situations where I have inappropriately ended up in bed with someone (not cheating, usually with exes or flatmates) I have been so drunk that I have needed someone to walk me home because not only can I not operate a car, I probably wouldn't even have been able to find it or work out which pedal did what. 
On the other hand, to be absolved of responsibility for cheating, the woman must be at least that level of drunk. If they were just tipsy, then the alcohol is no excuse.","version:

funny,cqib299,"There are loads of reasons, actually.  In a lot of older cities and towns the roads are too thin to allow traffic to pass both ways on all branches of the junction, so the cycling of lights also controls traffic through these pinch points.  So if you turned left on a red, you could come face to face with another vehicle, and have no space to pass. 
 Another reason is that, again due to the thinness of the roads, HGVs have to swing out into the opposite lane to turn, so again the traffic light cycle pattern in these cases is designed to not allow 2 way traffic, which a car turning left on red wouldn't appreciate. 
 You can see situations like this a lot if you look for junctions where the traffic lights are set back from the junction slightly, to allow HGVs to turn, or traffic to pass before entering a bottleneck. 
 Of course there are options such as different sign posts at these junctions, or filter arrows, but none of these options are anything close to free, so it is not the simple case of ""Why don't we just allow it?"" like it may seem at first glance.","UK roads are often too thin for this to work.

 Now, I bought my MacBook over three years ago. When I purchased it, I also bought the extended warranty (Apple Care). My Apple Care expired around August 5th of this year so I didn't hold high hopes (considering that I was now 4 and 1/2 months outside of warranty) when I took it in to the Apple Store. 
 When I took my MacBook into the store, an employee checked it out and confirmed my diagnosis. Despite the fact that I was over 4 months outside of my warranty, he took it in and replaced the broken CD drive at no charge while I waited in the store. When it was all done, he brought it out and said, ""Looks like your battery came up as bad so we replaced that one for you too."" 
 Needless to say, they earned my brand loyalty for a long while.","Apple replaced (at no charge) a failed DVD drive AND bad battery almost 5 months outside of the warranty and over three years after I bought the computer.

funny,c42ry9h,"heard a story once about a crack prostitute.  He was on a corner doing whatever crack prostitutes do on a corner and a limo pulls up.  Someone rolled down the window and told him to get in the back.  He does and they go to a hotel. As the rich man explains what he wants done to him he pulls out a giant box of fruits and vegetables.  It was something like the rich guy wanted to be tied to the bed naked while being pummeled with these fruits and veggies.  So the crack head says ok and starts just tossing the fruits at him and the man moans a bit and asks for him to do it harder.  So the crackhead kind of throws it harder and it bounces off the naked rich guy's chest and he moans louder and says he wants it harder.  Long story short, the crackhead is just wailing on this naked guy tied to the bed with fruits and the man is moaning like crazy.  Once all the fruit was gone, the crack head untied him and was given money and dropped on the corner.","crackhead prostitute pelts naked rich guy with fruits while he is tied to a hotel bed

funny,c8lxquu,"Yeah, umm, THANKS -  I GET the joke.gif. Spiderman's webs look like ejaculate. Great, amusing. I like semen humour as much as the next kid. But seriously - why does he web up the window and then punch it BEFORE opening it? I can't seem him doing anything to unlock the window, so clearly it was unlocked to begin with. Therefore couldn't he have just opened the window WITHOUT ejaculating on it and punching through the glass? 
 Now before you go ahead and say it - I know, I KNOW. 'Suspension of disbelief', rarr rarr rarr. I'm all for suspension of disbelief when it serves a narrative purpose, but in this instance there is clearly no purpose to him covering the web with spider goo and then punching through it. Clearly. No. Purpose. In fact, he may have jeopardised his pursuit of the villain by wasting those precious seconds webbing and punching the window. 
 So I suppose, in conclusion - no valid purpose to webbing/punching the window. Yet another prime example of the American arts scene pandering to the lowest common denominator and making nonsensical children's farce in the place of what should be quality superhero programming. If you look at more progressive countries like Sweden, this sort of thing is not happening. Admittedly, not as many famous superhero cartoon characters have emerged from Sweden, but Sweden does have many edgy and dynamic arts schools (thanks to very ample government funding) which are known to foster young animators, including the animators who worked on the famous Swedish animated romp [ Snövit Och de Sju dDvärgarna  (NSFW)]( I can't think of many better ways to be spending my time than watching Swedish animated film - and if I could think of some way - it would not be watching the spastic machinations of this animated downie you call Spiderman. !",Clear logic failure evident in Spiderman clip - recommend watching Swedish animation instead.

My family assumed that it just meant there'd be certain places with a haunted house, but the park itself would be fine. Well, it was extremely crowded, and it took forever to get on rides, so we figured if we stay later: everyone will be in the haunted houses and we can get on the rides!....our logic was very flawed. As we eventually realized we were wrong, we decided to leave....and behold...without a warning or anything, the front gate was starting to emit smoke, kids and their parents trying to get out of the park quickly....for what reason I did not know, until alas! behold! the park itself was becoming one giant haunted house.

 You don't have to hate pedophiles to agree that children need to be protected. Hating pedophiles has led to a mass hysteria that's resulted in the over protection of children (protecting them from the big bad wolf, and major over alert on stranger danger). There's no justification for harming a child. Nor is there justification for destroying the lives of someone who's peed, drunk, next to a play ground at 3am. Or prosecuting a 17 year old for sending nude pictures of themselves to someone (or receiving them from their underage girl/boyfriend). 
 The horrific reality of sexual abuse is that it's pretty rarely strangers who do it. Your kid is  far  more likely to be molested by a close relative or family friend than they are to be abducted off the street. 
 Instead, ""protect the children!"" has become the battle cry that has allowed ill-thought out legislation, not only causing people convicted and branded as pedophiles to have no place to legally live (forcing them to live in colonies under bridges, for instance), but also allowing a lot of other nasty stuff to happen.

 There are two options possible, either what the student stated is tuition for one year, or for his/her four years. 
 Let's round that 41,460 tacos up to 42,000 for easier math's sake. 
 Lets say there are 8 months over the year the printer is used, that's 32,000 tacos per year. 
 If the tuition is for one year, it takes 3/4 of a student's tuition for one printer for one year. There are probably tens, possibly a hundred printers over all of the campus. If you take that into account. That's pretty expensive for only printing. 
 Now let's take a look if it's for four years. It would take 128,000 tacos to run that printer for four years. It would take a little over 3 student's tuition to pay for that one printer over the course of the four years. That's a pretty expensive printer. 
 Now lets say there are 20 printers like this over the entire campus (or equal to that because some are used less). That cost the college 2,560,000 tacos every four years, or the tuition, if it was one year: 15 students, or if it was four years: 61 students.

Most who respect him still hold this and other aspects of his life against him, but look at the big picture and what he did for the country throughout his life. 
 >He was a dictator… 
 Was he a dictator like Hussein or Kim Il-sung who exploited his position? Or did he use absolute power to force policies he thought were best for the country? And his personal life also reflects what kind of dictator he was. It was a crucial period in Korea’s history. They needed a strong leader (holding lots of power) who could take reign over the country against tons of corrupt self-seeking opposition and who had the nation’s best interest at heart—this is crucial because they needed someone who wasn’t corrupt, who wasn’t going to screw over a budding nation for personal gain. 
 >setting the foundation for a paradoxical political system full of corruption… 
 Korea has been rife with corruption for almost their entire existence. Go back even thousands of years and tell me a period when Chosun didn’t have corruption and political in-fighting, that’s what you get from a race of people who are overly ambitious. And this is the very reason why I argue they needed someone like Park who was going to grab the bull by the horns and not take shit. He did take things too far, but a weaker leader would have caved. 
 >A short period of rapid development is expected… 
 Look at the Philippines and Marcos as an example of a leader who exploited a nations potential for personal gain (I remember growing up in Korea in the 70’s, even into the early 80’s, the Philippines was considered a more prosperous nation than Korea). While the Korean people’s diligence deserve most of the credit, Park implemented policies that maximized the nation’s potential.

This is sort of a temporary cure.  By eating some food you are distracting your body from your hangover. (if you dont hydrate during this time, you will still be in a shifty situation when your body switches back over) 
 If you don't have alcohol in your system and you don't feel good, you are dehydrated. That means your body is lacking water.  Drink water. 
 The best way to prevent a hang over is by drinking a half glass of water between a few beers.  Keep it up through the night. It only takes a few times if doing this to get used to it....   If you like to go out drinking, and are spending more money or are blacking out.... This is another good way to help with that.  Order a glass of water instead of the next round and you will be good. I like to have 2 or 3 beers than the water.  If you order a glass of water with your first drink, just make sure you drink the water... And remember to get it refilled every three drinks.

funny,c0rwnme,"You say you felt insecure around your own dog.  Well that's the problem.  You dog sensed your insecurity and was forced into taking the role of the pack leader. 
 What confuses people is that a healthy dog psychology actually has three traits: trust, affection, and respect.  A majority of the time, the first two are very easy to get.  You just have to feed your dog and love him/her.  However, people seem to think having the first two means that their dog will respect them. 
 That doesn't happen if your dog is forced to become the pack leader because it senses that you are insecure or weak.  If your dog bit you, it's because a pack leader biting a subordinate is normal and biting is used to place restrictions on the pack. Even the smallest and most gentle dogs will bite when they are forced to assume the pack leader role.  It's simply part of the job when you're a canine pack leader.  Humans, however, blow up bites as some kind of huge incident of dog mistraining or dog misbehavior when, in actuality, your dog is being an 100% normal dog. 
 At the same time, your newfound canine pack leader can seemlingly do a 360 and be affectionate and trustworthy and loyal, but still lacking respect. 
 This ""missing piece"" of the triangle, as Cesar calls it, accounts for 90% of so-called unexplainable and unexpected bites. 
 edit: one of the most striking examples of misconstrued bites was a recent episode of Dog Whisperer with two German Shephards.  The female constantly attacked the male and bit him.  The owner kept thinking something was wrong with the female, asking Cesar how to ""fix"" her and how to ""train"" her and what was wrong with her.  However, Cesar noticed that the male was harboring an unnatural obsession with the owner, constantly licking her, staying by her side, whining when she left.  The female shephard sensed this instability and was biting the male to keep him in line and let him know that this wasn't ok.  In her world, she simply wanted a stable pack.  Because she was constantly stopped before she could pin the male down and get across her message, along with being given an energy from the owners as the ""bad guy,"" she couldn't do her job and the male's instability only got worse and worse. 
 Cesar saw this immediately and told the owner what was happening.  He put them all in a room and waited for the male to show instability and the female to jump on him.  He quickly blocked the female and gave the energy and body language such that she knew he was taking over and addressing the instability.  She sat down and calmed down immediately.  He kept correcting the male until he realized his instability was wrong and the pack went back to normal.  Bites in this case were a good thing.  The biting female was actually the healthiest member of the pack.  But the human owners, because they don't understand dog psychology, only made everything 100% worse.  If the owner understood what was going on in the first place and took leadership as pack leader, none of it would ever had happened.  Owner was an old lady though.","A majority of dog owners don't understand dog psychology and think everything is about ""training."""

funny,ckq9lq1,"Without attempting a guess about the sexual position just yet, here I go with my analysis of the situation: 
 
 There are three  or four  people in the bathroom. 
 
 The person on the right is undoubtedly a woman. 
 
 The people wearing socks are most likely men, by judging their calves and fashion sense. 
 
 The woman is standing up straight, seemingly without making much effort to keep her posture. 
 
 The subject with the white socks appears to be sitting; please notice the shadows under his left foot, which proves that he is not supporting weight with that leg, hence relying on his buttocks to support himself. 
 
 The subject with the blue socks may have both feet on the floor; please observe the edge of our view between white-socks, the toilet bowl and the woman: that may quite possible be his right foot. 
 
 About the position of the subject with the blue socks: although we see that he is keeping himself on tip toes, this does not mean that he is standing straight against the wall. He could be squatting for all we see, maybe he is even sitting on the toilet bowl with white-socks, but having such a limited space he is trying to get as close to the back of the toilet as possible, which would include putting his knees forward almost touching the wall, very spread to get around the water deposit, and to further save space he is on tip toes making his knees get higher, keeping his thighs at an angle rather than parallel to the floor, so he can sit even closer to the wall. 
 
 
 Based on these assumptions, which I deem reasonable, I would conclude that we have two men sitting on the toilet bowl facing opposite directions while a woman stands very close to the one facing forward. 
 Although this makes it easy to think about many non-penetrative possibilities for white-socks and the woman, I am puzzled about blue-socks' role.","there are two men sharing the toilet bowl and a woman standing straight. 
 Edit: 
 
 There could be a fourth person (most likely a woman) sitting on top of the water deposit, with her feet resting on the toilet seat or on one of the men's shoulders. This would explain what blue-socks is doing, most likely performing oral sex.

funny,cjyzibw,"I'm a student from a school that is only nationally accredited, and has been taking students from even before they obtained national accreditation. That being said, I'd argue that it all depends on what degree you're getting, what kind if education you'll be getting and if you how best to utilize your degree to get into the career you want. 
 For example, my school specifically focuses on teaching students to train service dogs (and is the only university of its kind), with most students going for an Associate's degree in Assistance Dog Education. All gen ed credits need to be taken elsewhere. While attending this university, students are assigned service dogs in training that they train and take care of as part of their degree. This means we get experience while in school without needing to find internships. In my specific program, we even go through client-dog matching and graduate service dog teams. 
 For myself, this program is great because I want to train service dogs. Some organizations only require an Associate's degree and I'm hoping to snatch one of those jobs after graduation. Otherwise, I'm thinking I will get a Bachelor's in Psychology (as many guide and service dog organizations are looking for people with these kinds of Bachelor's degrees) and training dogs while finishing that up. I already have an Associate's in General Studies so I'd just need core classes.

funny,c6pq7yo,"Sure, so the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrirots (AUMF) was a joint resolution passed three days after 9/11. It's a wartime powers bill that granted the President the authority to engage in all necessary actions to fight against the terrorist organizations that caused 9/11. It was a primary basis for Gitmo, until the  Hamden  case said it wasn't good enough without proper commissions in 2006. 
 Post-Hamden there were discussions about the use of the AUMF, both because of it's specificity to the terrorists who were part of 9/11 (What do we do with any Al-Qaeda in Iraq members then? etc.) and because it had uncertain language about the end of the conflict. 
 So, section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA is a reaffirmation of the AUMF, with a scope that encompasses possible enemies in the War on Terror rather than simply Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. It also authorizes trial by tribunal to help assuage the Courts fears about no way to reassess status. The concern people have about its application to American citizens is because the clause DOES apply to citizens, who are fighting alongside these organizations (such as Hamdi (actually, once we bring up Hamdi it stands to note he is the only American Citizen who ever was held at Gitmo and was released back to Saudi Arabia after his lawsuit showing he had been born in America though he hadn't lived here, Padilla was held on foreign soil and Lindh was transferred into the American system)). Because this isn't technically a ""war"" there has to be special authorization, especially regarding Americans. 
 If anything, it's better to allow this at least semi-publically. Telling the military they can't detain persons captured in relation to terrorist activity (beyond the field of battle this also applies to people actively attempting things in the US, such as the attempt to take over a military base recently), means they will simply do it secretly in other countries.

funny,c0q7dpv,"I had a ""close encounters of the nice kind"" when I was in middle/high school. I was that ""bitch"" girl and even though we're still friends (who have grown apart since college) it makes me sad to this day. We'll call nice guy friend M for the purpose of this post. 
 M and I started as class-to-class walking buddies after we found out we both had a mutual love of the Redwall books. By the end of our first year of friendship we were inseparable: we liked the same things, we had the same sense of humor, we got along swimmingly. At this point I had a super-crush on my other friend (who would break my aching pre-teen heart by coming out of the closet at the end of 8th grade), so that tells you how well I read signals, lol. 
 Not long after the rebuff by my gay friend, I start noticing little changes. Each morning M happens to pop by my locker on the other end of school before homeroom, he's dropping hints at something (but I can't figure out what), he's paying more attention, etc. We go to movies and malls, play video games together, he holds doors open and pulls out chairs for me. Then he starts getting what I think was clingy. I get a creepy vibe, but blow it off. He never asks me if I want to date. I figure these are just the usual things best friends, even of the opposite sex, do when they are friends. 
 Then M invites me to the fall dance, and I think, ""great! a night out with my best friend! This will be fun!"". M shows up at the door with a flower in hand and the most adoring look on his face and I get this weird feeling of ""no, don't want this"". I suddenly got it. He liked me, and I had no idea.  I spent the entire night avoiding his touch, finding excuses not to dance, spending time in the bathroom or with tables of other friends. I was so confused, knowing I was being rude but not wanting to hurt M. He was my best friend. How could I do that to him? The next few weeks were awkward attempts of me trying to figure out how to tell him I wasn't into him in a dating way while not destroying him-- we were both nerds and picked on, so you could say we were ""socially fragile"". 
 I turned M down before he even got the chance to ask. I told him that I thought he had a crush on me, he fessed up, and I said I couldn't do it. He was heartbroken. I, who was his friend and matched in every way possible except ""that way"", said no. Our mutual friend (my gay ex-crush) IM'ed me a few days later and said that M had changed, he was listening to angry music and saying nothing mattered, and that he feared for M and was angry at me. I retorted that I had done M a favor by not stretching it out any longer, that I didn't like him in a dating way and saw him only as a friend. I really did. Nothing about him attracted me in a manner other than friendship. I didn't think I'd given off any other vibes. After some arguing, I made the mistake of agreeing to ""give it a chance"" for the sake of M. 
 Let's just say it didn't work. I knew it, by the way I felt and the ""no, no, no"" feeling I got when he tried to get close that it was what it was. After I said no the second time around, we didn't speak for nearly six months. I felt ashamed, guilty, and stupid. How did I not notice sooner? How could I have made it so that he didn't fall for me in the first place? Did I do the wrong thing by saying no to the nice guy just because I didn't like him ""that way""?","My best friend ended up wanting a relationship out of our friendship and went about it in a Nice Guy fashion. I ended up asking him if the vibes I was getting were real (since he never made a vocal admission), he fessed up, and I said no. Things got awkward; we're still friends.

funny,c3x41jl,"I get very frustrated with the modern art world. Art can be anything. I agree, and art is in the eye of the beholder. Something that is ugly can be mindblowingly beautiful to someone else. But here's the thing. What is the purpose of putting art in a museum? To be an institution of prestige and popularity? To keep and preserve art? To display it? Who is it being displayed for? Why? 
 Museums, particularly public ones, are there for the  public . They're not there for the artist. They're for the average Joe to have a chance to appreciate art. What makes art great is a combination of mastery and message, and the level of each can vary. Anyone can have a meaningful idea. And anyone can paint a canvas black. Anyone can make up some bullshit reason that a black canvas is meaningful. That doesn't make it worthwhile to the public. This is why there's a growing dissonance in the arts. 
 Art is about expression. Art knows no language or cultural barriers.  Real  art transcends time itself because it was capable of communicating with it's viewers. The piece expresses itself, and the viewers catch a glimpse of sheer, unbridled beauty within it. But the viewers MUST be capable of seeing that beauty. Art is just another form of communication. What's happening (or, I supposed  has  been happening for a while now) is that people are complicating the language of art. They're getting further and further from the simplicity that makes art so damn powerful. 
 If art can't express itself, it's not art. If art only expresses itself to the creator, or to those few who understand it's complicated language, if you have to  learn all about the field just to understand it , then the piece hasn't done a proper job of expression. The piece of art hasn't accomplished it's sole purpose, and thus doesn't deserve to sit in a public museum. 
 Modern art is just a cluster fuck of circle-jerks. Art is visceral. Art is deep. A painting does what a book can't. It can bring a message to a vast majority of people. A child, an elderly person, a middle-aged mother of 5, a lonely man that lives on the other side of the planet, you don't have to understand  why  it's great to  feel  from it, to  see  something. 
 Anyone who tries to defend shit like a shovel or black canvas need to stop for a moment and think about what art is. Not to the 'art world', not to the artist. What is art to the human race? What does it do? What is its purpose in the greater scheme of things? To me, it's very fucking simple. ""We were here. We felt. We lived. We wanted to share experiences and ideas."" 
 Scribbles don't say that. A shovel doesn't say that. A black canvas doesn't fucking say that. If anyone can do it, it's not worthy of being championed as greatness. Sure, it's art (at least in my definition of art), but it's not the kind of art that deserves a prestigious, circle-jerk position in a public venue to be celebrated for years to come. 
 Edit  Adding a","The power of art is its ability to transcend cultural boundaries to send its message to anyone. If you have to spend years in an art school to understand the pieces in your public museum, there is something  very wrong . Great art isn't for the artist or select few. Great art has two main elements; mastery and message. If mastery is low, message must be high. If the message can't be even half-assedly grasped by the average Joe, the piece has failed. The modern art world is celebrating failure and creating more dissonance between the public and art. This is bad, very bad."

 According to  Wikipedia . 
 Assuming that the average male gains the ability to cum at about 13 years old ( source . 
 For the purposes of this calculation, I will say that the average male starts to experience a declining function of his ability to cum around age 60. 
 And finally I will assume that the average male will cum around 4 days a week. 
 Average years of cumming time: 47 years 
 Number of weeks in a year: 52 weeks 
 Number of cums per year: 208 
 Number of cums per lifetime: 9,776 cums 
 Amount of cum ejaculated: 9,776 x 2.3 to 4.9 ml = 22,484.8 to 47,902.4 ml 
 Converting ml to US system: 6 to 12.5 gallons of cum 
 Assuming a more active male, (7 times a week, 4.9 ml, 13 years to 80 years) it would be: 67 years x 52 weeks per year x 7 times per week x 4.9 ml per cum = 119,501.2 ml or 31.56 gallons of cum.

Additionally parents that cry public outrage when their child is molested are actually hurting their kids more than the molester did.  Being molested is like being cut, it will heal in time.  Bringing the incident up time and time again and making it public is like keeping that wound open and it might begin to fester.  Parents cannot absolve themselves by publicly accusing people of molesting their children.  They will feel guilt, but they should feel more for not adequately seeing to their child's needs.

 Is CDC changing its estimate of obesity-related deaths? 
 ""Yes. We are no longer going to use the previous annual estimate of 365,000 deaths from
poor nutrition and physical inactivity.
Instead, CDC will state, The latest study based on a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults estimates that about 112,000 deaths are associated with obesity each year in the United States.” 
 Why is this latest estimate of the number of deaths (112,000) so much lower than the number (365,000) CDC issued within the past year? 
 ""There are two main reasons for the difference in the estimated number of obesity deaths
that CDC scientists have published over the past year: newer data and different methods
of analyzing the data.
The use of newer and different data sets (from different samples of the population)
accounts for most of the difference. Earlier estimates only reflected the obesity-related
health risks that people experienced in the 1970s. The newer data (some with mortality
follow-up through 2000) appear to reflect a real decline in the risks of dying from
obesity-related diseases like heart disease.
Big improvements in the control of risk factors for heart disease, such as better drug
management of high blood pressure and cholesterol, may have resulted in far fewer
people dying today as a result of obesity. The new data may also reflect advances in lifesaving
interventions for obesity-related diseases (such as catheterization and reperfusion
therapy for heart attacks). CDC will continue to monitor these trends and take steps to
ensure that even fewer people will die of obesity in the future.
The recent study also used different statistical methods to estimate the proportion of
deaths in the population related to obesity. These methods took into account the decline
in obesity-related deaths among older adults.""","Read it.

 So what's my point? Well take a look! Searching through these comments all i see is shared opinion...and that's not because it's some right opinion(there is no right/wrong in life in the first place, because anyone can dictate that), its because people just love to agree, and i find it so horrible that that's the case...it completely sucks out any free-will, just like the whole atheist ordeal..where people just agree because ""Everyone on Reddit told me X or y"", you don't get concepts and ideas from other people! All you ""atheists"" are doing it wrong, you research the topic very carefully, outline why and why not's and then make a decision, not looking at:

funny,c2gcqx1,"This is exactly what I ended up having to do in 2 separate group projects when I was getting my Bachelors. Both times, the groups were assigned. Mind you, I've also had 2 decent group experiences and 1 that was amazing. 
 But the ones I remember most are the shitty ones. 
 
 Project #1 
 Assigned to group by prof. Class is organizational something or other. Kind of a fluffy topic. I'll give some nicknames to help you identify the participants. 
 My group: 
 -Me 
 -Exchange1 : Exchange kid who only gets into class cause she pays 200% of what I pay in international tuition fees. Has poor english skills and is EXTREMELY self conscious, so much so that she WILL NOT speak unless you directly ask her a question, and even then, she speaks in a whisper. 
 -Slacker1 : Native American woman who only got into faculty/class because she is Native American and gets access to reserved spots. Comes to class and is EXTREMELY defensive if I try to give direction or divide tasks, DOES NOT like to take orders 
 -Slacker 2 : Native American woman who only got into faculty/class because she is Native American and gets access to reserved spots. Barely comes to class, stops coming entirely after a month. 
 So I am trying desperately to organize some kind of meeting, as the class is an evening class and the group doesn't want to hang out at 9PM after class, nor do they want to meet at 5PM before class, because it is rush hour, eating dinner etc. etc. 
 Slacker2 stops coming to class without any notice to myself or group. All efforts to contact this person fail. We assume she dropped class. As my other group members are happy to discuss the work but not to discuss implementation, I divide the tasksk amongst the 3 of us that remain. 
 At this point, Slacker1 decides to start fighting everything I say. I say I'll do this, no she wants to, I say you should do that, no, she doesn't want to. She hates taking orders from me. I can understand that, I don't fucking live GIVING orders, but you leave me no choice when nobody else steps up. Either you volunteer, you take leadership of the group, or you do as you are told. 
 I give some simpler tasks to Exchange1 and give myself most of the technical work, diagrams, tables, appendices, specific things prof asked for as well as translating Exchange1's work into proper English and typing it up for her. 
 I give Slacker1 some fluffy work to do and figure she can bullshit her way through it no problem. 
 Flash forward to last week of project work. Slacker1 is doing some work, I correct her and tell her the prof asked for a table format with references to table instead of a big writeup of data in the body of the project. Slacker1 decides to fight me on this and tells me this is how she is doing it. So now I have to start editing her work as she's working on it as well, taking her crap out of the project and putting it into a table and then referencing it back into the project. 
 Now Slacker1 tells the group that Slacker2 DID NOT drop the class as we assumed, and she says we should call Slacker2 because we should give her one last chance of helping out. I say no, she didn't contact us at all, didn't come to class, and hasn't done anything for us. 
 At this point, the only reason Slacker1 was sticking up for Slacker2 was either: 
 
 To annoy me 
 
 Sticking up for a fellow Native American 
 
 
 or a combination of the above. 
 I have had enough of the group, and since we're pretty much done, I tell her we have nothing left for her to do. Slacker1 says let her do intro/conclusion, and so we did. 
 So I carried the group, had to fight with Slacker1 everytime we met about getting simple things done, and let Slacker2 get her name on the project. 
 That was my learning experience. This was simultaneous with my best group experience though, so I was more willing to let stuff slide. 
 
 Project #2 
 My next group project, I applied some of the lessons learned from the first one. 
 This was a 4th year class and you would assume that the students at this point are competent and willing to work. The groups were assigned, and again, I got put into a group with a bunch of morons. This was worse than the above group though, because this group of morons WERE NOT WILLING TO DO ANY WORK. 
 This group was bigger though, 5 people including myself. 
 Basically, the group was told that every member of the group would have to allocate marks. By default, the split was even, but if the group felt that one person didn't pull their weight, they could take marks from that person and re-distribute them. 
 By default, only myself and one other person were actually willing to do any work. Unfortunately that one other person had the writing of a 10th grade student. 
 At one point, I had arranged a meeting to discuss details and write out things as a group that no single person would volunteer to write. I didn't offer to write because I was already doing more of the work than any other member. 
 Only 2 girls showed up, the 2 guys didn't. They just sat there waiting for others to show, I said we should start working and they said OK. 
 So I pull out some paper and begin drafting some lines, then I realize I'm doing all the work. One of them is sitting on either side of me watching my work and not doing anything. I tell them that if I'm the only one doing work, then I'm going to take more marks from the group. 
 At this point one of them gets upset and says that isn't fair, to which I reply, if we do equal work we should get equal shares of the mark, otherwise whoever does more should get more. 
 So with the 2 guys still not showing, I say lets get to a computer so we can quickly type up something that looks professional. I offered to let one of them do the typing but neither would. So I sat at a computer and waited for them to come up with something, and that was basically that. We just sat there and waiting because neither one said anything. A complete waste of an hour. 
 When I got fed up trying to get them to work or meet up, I talked to the prof. He said tell the group if you do more work you'll take more marks. So when it came time to write up an intro/conclusion, I told the group that I would do it but I would take more marks since I'd already done most of the writing. Instead, the other guy who was willing to work but incompetent replied that he'd do one instead and wrote 2 sentences for intro and conclusion at a level that was even below high school. He just wrote 2 random sentences, nothing that touched on our project or important points, nothing that summarized our work, just 2 generic sentences on our topic. I replied right away and told him that it wasn't of the quality we should be putting into the project and that he only wrote 3 sentences. It was just fluffy crap, 'we have observed and indicated some stuff to be improved', nothing specific and we'd get a shitty mark. Another group member volunteered to do it and copied the first guy's conclusion and added one line. 
 At this point, I basically gave up. 
 The last thing to do was make powerpoint slides. One guy had been allocated to do the powerpoint stuff since he didn't do any of the project writeup. The night before the presentation was due, I asked him how far along he was, he e-mailed the group 4 slides that he had finished. 4 when we needed at least 10-15 or so with graphics and headings etc. etc. 
 So I ended up finishing the slides the night before. 
 At the presentation the teacher purposely started asking the kids other than me difficult questions to see who had and who had not done any work, it was obvious and kind of embarrassing but there was some schadenfreude. 
 I talked to the prof again because I believed it was unfair to get a shitty mark and he let me do a make-up assignment. He was a shitty prof, the group was shitty. 
 Well, this felt good to get off my chest. Now I'll try to distill some of my lessons: 
 
 Talk to the prof, TALK EARLY, and talk often if you need to. Let him know how important the mark is to you and that you are working hard and which groups members are not working hard. 
 
 If group members are not working, tell the group that you won't do extra work without extra compensation or marks or some kind of agreement 
 
 If group members DO NOT do work, make sure the group knows that, make sure the group agrees on that fact 
 
 Do NOT let slacking group members do some small bit at the end and take credit. Unfortunately this happened to me both times, but was unavoidable because the rest of the group wanted to let the slacker take full credit 
 
 DO force the group to get stuff in ASAP and review and re-write stuff when needed. This may be extremely trying, but it is your mark too, at least if the group is trying, then I wouldn't feel as bad when re-writing stuff. 
 
 
 Funny side story, group project in high school, finished project, handed it in to group leader who was assembling it all. I come to class for presentation, find out she COMPLETELY re-wrote what I had and changed it so that it was no longer relevant to the task I had. The prof noticed too and asked the group why my task was missing, I had to state that I was responsible and took the blame in front of the class. Damn girl didn't even apologize to me for making me out to be a dumbass in front of the class.","document everything 
 be assertive 
 tell the group if you feel you are doing most of the work 
 make shit clear in e-mails, what you've done, what you're unhappy about, what needs doing, where everyone is (verbally people will be vague, claim they forgot etc. etc.) 
 complain to the prof so he knows BEFOREHAND, so you don't end up complaining after you get your mark and he tells you 'too bad, so sad, GTFO' 
 let prof know how hard you are working and that it isn't fair, tell him you've tried engaging the group 
 if all else fails, ask prof for a make-up assignment, any decent prof should do this 
 appreciate that these situations develop your leadership experience tremendously"

That's the nature of how exponential growth, and posts on reddit, work. For my post to get 31 downvotes in such a short period of time suggests there is a group of users, or one user with many accounts, who are systematically down voting my post.

funny,chhk17c,"The Station Agent 
 and even though some quick googling can give us the answer, I'm like 90% sure there's actual differences between midgets and dwarves. I'm pretty sure that midget (pc term little person) is someone that's just short. Below a specific height. Regardless of the reason, if you're that short, you're a midget/little person (what this means is that your limb proportions are still accurate) 
 whereas with Dwarves (and I may be getting this backwards), it's an actual genetic thing where their limb lengths are closer to non-dwarves, but they aren't proportionate. 
 okay, i did the wikipedia search because I got interested. I was pretty close-- long story short, different people use the different terms differently... so while midget  can  mean ""proportionate dwarf"" (meaning their limbs are all normal proportions), some people also just use it interchangeably with dwarf.","The Station Agent is a sweet movie, Dinklage is awesome in it, and there's no correct usage for the terms little person, dwarf, or midget, so just call them people."
funny,cemeam4,"Thank you for reading this far and for continuing to take this thread seriously even though we are in /r/funny. 
 From your reply, I'm not sure you are grokking that I think vulnerability is a complex process. I say this because of the way you speak of vulnerability is one in which you ""regret"",  ""consider a trial"", ""being vulnerable to situations I should have been strong during"".  Do I understand you correctly? Or do you have an example in which you became vulnerable and good things came of it? (you don't have to share, I'm just asking if you have had this?) 
 re: feminism 
Now I'm not interested in this topic so much. I kind of feel anxious with  'ism'  words. I also like yourself, don't fully agree with how this girl is formulating her point.  But differently. This is what I hear in her statement. 
> ""I need a movement/ideology to back me up on the point that being vulnerable (and who knows how she is using the term here, though I suspect she groks the complexity of the word 'vulnerability' similar to how I do) is not to be misunderstood or misrepresented as weakness because I don't think many people have a conscious understanding of the type of vulnerability I am referring to. And I have been hurt trying to practice that form of vulnerability with people that don't understand. I hope this changes.""

 However, when I see 24/03/2011 and 01/07/2011, I first have to look at the first set of numbers, remember them and know that they don't mean anything yet, but could be important, dependent on the second set of numbers.  Then, I look at the second set of numbers, realize that no matter what the first set of numbers are, the former comes before the latter.

 Nearly all teachers demand maximum focus for their classes, but it isn't anything actually hard. If anything, that approach just makes it look more difficult than it is. That would be the biggest flaw. 
 It's the same in every educational phase, from primary school to universities. 
 The educational system is trying to follow EU standards and stuff like that, but we're still behind. 
 The Church has heavy roots in pretty much every layer of Croatian society, including our educational system. Especially our educational system, I'd dare say. 
 The Church has been pushing to ban health education classes from all schools (because sex-ed is a part of them) and they actually succeeded because our supreme court declared those classes illegal due to a technicality. 
 The fact that religious groups knew and published the verdict  a day before the court officially published it  demonstrates how far religious roots go. 
 The fact that schools still ""offer"" religious classes but can't provide basic health education can't really be commented with anything polite. 
 The fact that most of our young hopes just go work in some other country as soon as they get the chance speaks for itself. 
 Buying diplomas and bribing officials to pass exams and similar stuff was pretty common up until a few years ago. We basically had an educational corruption scandal on a yearly basis.

 People freak out when they see that I have my address on my website, afraid that the mere fact that someone could hunt me down and kill me means it will happen.  I remind them of those old things call ""phone books"" where you can look up people's addresses anyway, or resumes which typically contain mailing addresses on them.

If you were malicious, you would have taken that information and done your bad deeds with it, rather than making your would-be-victim aware of what they leave out there.  Not that threatening someone online is excusable, but that's nowhere near what you did. 
 I think (read: hope) that the reddit admins realize that the problems of harassment stemming from posting someone's personal information is from the emotions people feel towards the party whose contact information is now public.  If I shared the cell phone number of the soldier who threw that puppy off a cliff in 2010 (2009?), then internet vigilantes would have a field day, even if the phone number I gave was of my rival and not the person in question.  If, however, I posted the mailing address of the girl with cancer and a bucket-list for cards and donations to be sent to, it's likely that more good will come of that than any harm. 
 Ultimately, we don't really care about the girl you were talking about, you, me or 99% of the rest of this website.  If you PMed me your social security number and address, I'd PM you back ""what's this for?"".  We don't care, and for those who are deathly afraid of stalkers, that's a good thing.  The same logic applies to terrorists and the TSA: planes aren't safe because we have the TSA ensuring no bombs get on planes, but because  no one wants to bring a bomb onto a plane .

 Years later, another friend ask me to DJ a party at his church. It was supposed to be for a children's charity, so I said I'd do it for free. 70's music, costumes, etc. - no problem. The week before, I scouted out the location so I'd know what to bring, and I found out it wasn't at his old church, but at a new one... a fundamentalist church. Also, it wasn't a children's charity, but a fundraiser for a children's ministry building. Completely different thing. While scouting, I met a former co-worker who asked if I was going to attend their services. Jokingly, I said, ""Hell, no!"" He laughed, my ""chaperone"" did not. 
 I was not happy, but I had told them I would already (and for free), so I did it anyway. However, I let my friend know that I wasn't thrilled about doing this. He was sufficiently chastised, and all was well.","Lesson learned - be wary of Christians, because they try and trick you."

 I've heard meth called, by ""habitual users"", ice, glass, crystal, tina (which can also sometimes be coke... that leads to confusion sometimes, be clear when you shop), various other female names starting with ""Chris/Kris"" (Krista, Chrissy, etc.) and a handful of other things. 
 Ice and glass tend to be higher quality.  Usually if you're calling it by a female name, it's within a specific social group and that name refers to the usual level of quality.  Club going gay men asking for Tina will get pissed if they get handed crank. 
 And other names may apply for special varieties.  Blue meth, for example, can have a ton of other names or ""trade names"".  It's all a part of the marketing. 
 Similarly, ecstasy has a kind of marketing edge based around the logo on the pill pressing.  At a given time, a specific logo might indicate really good quality pills, so people will go looking all over for ""Cherry Bombs"" or ""Triple Stacked Mitsubishis"".  So on and so on.

We got back to her place that afternoon and charged upstairs to her room, ready to go crazy on each other.

funny,c982x9g,"haha @ EE class. Yes, assuming the voltages are right and it's not a cheap  crappy adapter you're fine. Ohm's law is V=IR, so when there's a constant voltage (5V), and your phone has a given resistance, it draws a certain amount of power (say 1.5 amps) What the power supply is capable of providing is completely irrelevant. If you used a lab-grade power supply capable of providing 100 amps the phone would still only draw 1.5 amps given it's resistance. Now, when the phone's resistance is such that it wants to draw more amps than the power supply can produce (say 1.5 amps, while hooked up to a 1 amp power supply), several things can happen. They all depend on how smart your phone is, and how smart your charger is. It's possible you might overheat and damage the charger (this is common with cheap import ones, which contain no smart circuitry). It's also possible the charger will start to decrease the output voltage slightly. In this case, the phone will typically sense the voltage sag, and use it's charge controller to lower it's resistance on the supply line, pulling less power. If you had a dumb phone, or a completely restive load, you'd still draw less current due to the lower voltage.

 In you'll see that on average porn actors only stay in the industry for 3-4 years, which indicates that many in the industry see it as a part time job until something better comes along, they finish paying for school, or finish going through school.

funny,cf0y116,"This is the classic logic of someone justifying the abuse they receive: 
 You have good clean drinking water because of minimum water quality standards from the  government . Your daily medications is safe to take because  government  regulations insure their safety and that they work as advertised. 
 All but $10.00 of your daily medication is paid for by your employer's medical plan because some  government  legislation protected union workers while they fought their employers for paid medical insurance, now you get it too. 
 Your breakfast bacon is safe to eat because of  government  laws to regulate the meat packing industry. 
 The bottle for the shampoo you use in your morning shower is properly labeled with every ingredient and the amount of its contents because the  government  gave you the right to know what you are putting on your body and how much it contained. 
 The air you breath is clean because  government  laws stop industries from polluting our air. 
 Your morning subway commute is subsidized by the  government ; it saves you considerable money in parking and transportation fees. You see,  government  gives every one affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor. 
 You have a good job with excellent pay, medicals benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some  government  labor regulations created good working standards. Your employer pays these standards because your employer doesn’t want his employees to call the  government -protected union. If you are hurt on the job or become unemployed you’ll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because the  government  doesn't think you should lose your home because of your temporary misfortune. 
 You need to make a bank deposit so you can pay some bills. Your deposit is federally insured by the FDIC because the  government  protects your money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the depression. 
 You have to pay your Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and your below market-rate federal student loan because some  government  decided that it would be better off if you were educated and earned more money over your life-time. 
 After work, you plan to visit your father in the evening at his farm home in the country. You get in your car for the drive to dad's; your car is among the safest in the world because of  government  made car safety standards. You arrive at your boyhood home. You were the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers Home Administration because bankers didn’t want to make rural loans. The house didn’t have electric until  government  stuck its nose where it didn’t belong and demanded rural electrification. 
 You are happy to see our dad who is now retired.

funny,cfwje82,"Welp, she's an actress, so she makes a living out of performing. And that's not always limited to the movie set or the packed auditorium. Entertainers who get famous and stay famous/have a meteoric rise and sustained success over a few years usually don't just get there on their in-character performances alone. They have to know how to play to their audience in interviews, on red carpets, anywhere that will be recorded and disseminated to the public. It's savvy to be likeable, especially relatively early in a young film star's career. A lot of buzz, admiration and fans makes for money in the pockets of the industry. 
 While I like to believe that she's just a genuinely goofy, anti-Hollywood-bullshit girl, it's possible that this is just one small part of her that her team of publicists/agents/stylists have spun out into a whole persona because it plays well with her audience.

 Yes.  And you know what, if your only donating so you can brag about it, fuck you.  Give money because it's the right thing to do, give it because you believe in the charity.  Don't give money because you can brag about it  Give because you care.  Because a person who cares might not give 150k this month, but might give a hundred every month for the rest of their life. 
 This is the same bullshit as Dove or some other company saying ""for every donation we'll give a dollar to X charity""  it's complete bullshit, they don't ""care"", they could just give the maximum allowed amount to the fund, but what they really want is an increase in sales, and then they get the tax benefit for donating. 
 I'm not saying all charity should be silent, and the idea of ""we should give to X, who's with me"" is good but the idea that it's all about showing off how much you donate is kind of disgusting.

 In the late '60s, early '70s there was a gimmicky, campy, and largely forgettable villain called Mr. Metallix. 
 He loved metal and was always about ""capturing"" the various supplies of them, which was slang for him...I dunno, sucking them into his arm or something?  It was never clear.  He could create and shoot metal spikes though, which kinda confused me as a kid because...why didn't he just absorb those?  Maybe that's just him regurgiating the stuff his pocket dimension ate, BUT I digress. 
 Speaking of confusing, this Captain America rogue had an arbitrary weakness to one type of metal.  And what type would that be?  You guessed it - vibranium.  Like, we're talking Metal Man from MM2 levels of 'why'.  It was pretty much kryptonite to him, and on top of that it was never explained (not even a half-apathetic silver-or-bronze-age asspull) and the readers were just kinda told about it up front.  But yeah, he would always have some way to avoid being just clobbered by or just terminally weakened from being  in the same room as  the shield in the meager number of issues he appeared in. 
 Anyway, general plots would involve him trying to steal stocks of metal that were even vaguely famous - for example, precious metals like the mythical stockpile at Fort Knox. 
 And, in this issue, to the best of my recollection, he winds up getting shrunken down in the aftermath of Cap-versus-multiple-villains brawl.

And somehow Mr. Metallix finds his way inside of Cap and is wreaking havoc despite his microscopic stature.

funny,cazq82d,"You're correct, but you can't only have that mindset.  There are people out there who have been training years and look good doing padwork.  Second they start sparring, they just lose their shit.  It's something you have to train as well.  In fact, you're supposed to do both so much that basic techniques(such as punching and kicking) will be muscle memory.  You don't want to walk into a fight and think about rolling your shoulder up, keeping your hands up, turning your hip over, etc.  You want to read your opponent, find weaknesses and habits, good counters, baiting, etc. 
 Then, there are specific rules for sparring, such as kicks only or one person kicking/other punching, so people can train these techniques in a nice controlled environment, where they may not be using them as much(because they are new).  Another huge benefit of this, is seeing other people throw then at you(and you don't know it's coming).  You learn to read the general body movement of what leads into it, and what is a good defense/counter. 
 That's why a lot of TMAs fall into the gutter.  At some point, you need to train with a resisting opponent, or you'll never truly improve.  Getting hit(and even hard) is a really good wake up call.  You can be perfect in an easy-going sparring environment, but until you actually get tagged hard, you'll never really learn your bad habits under pressure.

funny,c5t5k2s,"Dear Everyone STOP BITCHING ABOUT YOUR FLIGHT BEING DELAYED. 
 People of today, you don't realize how good you have it in terms of traveling to different parts of the world. It's so easy to get frustrated and flabbergasted when our flights are delayed for microscopic amount of time. Before you all up in arms about how it sucks to fly anywhere or get stuck in a airport, let me take you back to 1903. 
 In 1903 controlled powered flight was invented by the Wright Brothers. Before then, if you wanted to travel anywhere, you had to either travel by ship or by train. Up until the 1930s the only thing that planes were utilized for, was delivering mail. It wasn't until the introduction of the Boeing 247 and Douglas DC-3 in 1930's that traveling by air was even possible. Even then, traveling by air was reserved for the elites. The masses still traveled by trains and ships. 
 Traveling by railroad and ships was the way to go for the masses until up until 1957 when Boeing launched the 707 into the air. This as well as [other aircraft]( paved the way for the modern airlines to trasport a massive amount of people. 
 To cross the Atlantic today in a modern ship that has GPS takes about 5 days, 2 to 3 WEEKS during 1900 to the 1950s. I don't know how long or how shitty it must have been pre1900's Travel time from NY to LA in a train. Today it takes about 3 days with stops along the way. During the 1900s it would be at least a week, which was still the way to travel pre-1950's. 
 Just imagine that for a second pre-1950's, if you lived in the US and it's going to take you 2-3 weeks to travel across the Atlantic. Fuck that, right? Or it's going to take you a week to travel from NY to LA by train with having to switch railroads along the way. Traveling back then, i'm sure it was hell viewed with our modern eyes. But travel has advanced so far in just 50 years. 
 Traveling today is a fucking JOY. It's AWESOME because for a few hundred bucks you can fly from where you are to ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD in UNDER A DAY. So what if you get delayed an hour, or 24, you're still traveling faster than anyone would pre 1950's. NY to London in under 8 hours. Chicago to HongKong in under 16 hours. These travel times are exponentially shorter than anything we've ever achieved... ever! And what about pre-1800?! Could you imaging traveling Oregon Trail style? Doesn't matter how many bullets you'd bring, we would all die from dysentery. 
 Look, it sucks that you got delayed 24 hours and that United didn't care about you as a customer.

funny,c7dtgzi,"Many of these threads have degenerated into ""bash Korea and Koreans,"" all because of a simple translation error. 
 As to why many Koreans are anti-American despite the US having saved South Korea during the Korean War, there are many factors. 
 First, especially since the 1980s, there has been a growing perception that the US was responsible for the initial division of the country after WWII, which eventually caused the Korean War in the first place. Not only that, Americans favored installing a right-wing authoritarian government instead of a more moderate regime. However, most Koreans were indeed thankful for American intervention in the Korean War until 1980, which brings up my second point. 
 In 1980, there was a massive uprising in the city of Gwangju against the imposition of martial law. The people were initially protesting the military's takeover of the government, but the excessive brutality displayed by the martial law soldiers caused most of the population to join in the protests. The soldiers started firing, and so the citizens armed themselves and drove the soldiers out for about 5 days, before the military retook control of the city. 
 What was the role of the US in this? They didn't do much. In fact, they  couldn't  do much except protest against first the military coup and then against military brutality. In addition, the Iran crisis was happening at the same time, and so American policymakers (despite Carter having strongly advocated for human rights in South Korea) desired stability first and foremost in order to not turn Korea into ""another Iran."" 
 But of course, in the Koreans' eyes, the US was the superpower who should be able to force the military to give way. The fact that the Americans did not intervene to help the citizens of Gwangju and open the way for democratization caused many Koreans, especially the younger generation in the 1980s, to have a very negative view of the US. They saw the US as being hypocritical with regards to human rights and democracy, and thought that the US viewed Korea only as one base among many others in its extensive global empire - as a neocolonial power. 
 These sentiments still have force today, especially if you look at the anger over events such as when American soldiers were acquitted by an American court of running over two Korean schoolgirls in 2002 in addition to the 2008 US-SK FTA agreement (i.e. the beef protests). Not to mention how many South Koreans were angered over the Bush Administration's initial stonewalling of negotiations with North Korea when the South Korean presidents were seemingly making progress in establishing cordial relations with the North. The US is still generally seen as a domineering superpower bullying weaker countries, even allies, such as South Korea around. 
 But despite all this, to generalize that all Koreans are racist and xenophobic, or that all Koreans hate Americans is silly and counterproductive (although I will admit many Koreans do hold racist/xenophobic opinions). There are still many Koreans who love America and Americans, and many tales of Koreans going out of their way to help Americans.","History is complex. US-South Korean relations are complex. Public perceptions matter. Also, not all Koreans are racist or anti-American. Duh."

funny,co7cxma,"Story time. 
 My friend's parents trusted my friend, so for his senior year of high school, they let him live on his own. They bought a townhouse and let him pay reduced rent. This was a stupid decision, and we used his house for a constant stream of good times. It was awesome, but we were reckless, and became very familiar with town cops. 
 This one night, we invite these really crazy girls over because they were stupid hot and also very stupid. We were wary about it, because you just don't stick your dick in crazy, but we had no other options for the night. Everything was going fine, until my friend gets a call from another group of girls, who say they're outside in the parking lot. 
 The other group of girls were best friends with the girls we were hanging out with, but for whatever reason, the two groups hated each other on that particular night. The girls we were with demanded we made the other girls leave, so we did. We went outside, sat in their car, and explained the situation. 
 As this was happening, two cop cars double park behind the girl's car. The officer says he received a suspicious vehicle call, and the girl driving absolutely lost it. She was a huge bitch to the cop about it, which prompted him to search the car. She ended up going down for Xanax, and one of my friends went down for a dime of weed. 
 We were completely blindsided by the whole thing, and we knew it had to be the girls we were hanging out with. We went back inside, confronted them about it, and they said ""those bitches got what they deserved"". We obviously freaked out and immediately kicked them out. 
 A couple months later, the girl that called the cops says she wants to make it up to us. We say we never want to see her again, but she just shows up anyway. The girl that was arrested for Xanax was with her. I've never been so mad and confused at the same time. Apparently, they only hated each other because one hooked up with the other one's boyfriend. Getting the other one arrested is child's play I guess.

We were at a benefit show a few weeks ago, and though he's normally a patient guy, he was getting pretty frustrated at every opening he could look through being filled with amateur videographers' arms and phones. We shamed the girls directly in front of us into putting their phones down, but a much larger guy a few people in front of them either couldn't hear us or didn't care and kept blocking everyone's view. 
 Suddenly my tiny ninja  LUNGES  through an opening in the crowd and jabs the guy right in the nerve cluster at the back of his elbow, then darts back.

 From the National library of medicine: 
 >Tetanus is a serious illness caused by Clostridium bacteria. The bacteria live in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. The bacteria can enter the body through a deep cut, like those you might get from stepping on a nail, or through a burn. 
 >The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to ""locking"" of the jaw. This makes it impossible to open your mouth or swallow. Tetanus is a medical emergency. You need to get treatment in a hospital. 
 >A vaccine can prevent tetanus. It is given as a part of routine childhood immunization. Adults should get a tetanus shot, or booster, every 10 years. If you get a bad cut or burn, see your doctor - you may need a booster. Immediate and proper wound care can prevent tetanus infection. 
 From Wikipedia: 
 >Tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium Clostridium tetani.[9] Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails. Objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors, or in places that harbour anaerobic bacteria, but the rust itself does not cause tetanus nor does it contain more C. tetani bacteria. The rough surface of rusty metal merely provides a prime habitat for C. tetani endospores to reside in, and the nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound. 
 >An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Because C. tetani is an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment is caused by the oxidization of the same object that causes a puncture wound, delivering endospores to a suitable environment for growth.[10] 
 >Tetanus is an international health problem, as C. tetani spores are ubiquitous. The disease occurs almost exclusively in persons unvaccinated or inadequately immunized.[2] It is more common in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter. This is particularly true with manure-treated soils, as the spores are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens.[3] Spores can be introduced into the body through puncture wounds. In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism. The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin.[3] Heroin users, particularly those that inject the drug, appear to be at high risk of contracting tetanus.",its in the dirt and on the rust and in manure.

funny,ccmrk9v,"I work at a vet clinic and am also in charge of dealing with every angry customer; which I actually enjoy doing, very interesting and fun for me. I had one client come in with his 90 pound Rottweiler that was extremely aggressive, we have been seeing this client for the last 20 years and every single one of his pets has notes in his chart with ""will bite"" and ""use caution"" stickers on it. As well as numerous notes from other technicians, doctors noting the pets aggression and amount of restraint to see his pets. (our clinic has a strict no aggressive pets policy and we are suppose to send them away since it is a physical and legal liability for us and the pets and owners. We usually still try to see them if we can and the owner of the practice likes to help people.) This particular time he brought the dog in for a heartworm test and rabies vaccine. So we have to draw blood from one of the front legs to run the test, which requires a muzzle on an aggressive dog, The last time the dog came in it required 4 technicians to hold the dog down and a muzzle with a basket muzzle over the first one to give the dog one vaccine near the right hip. Time before that it required the owner of the clinic using a rabies catch pole on the dog, 2 techs, 2 muzzles an IM injection of a sedative, to calm the dog. (Note all of this is done with the owner in the room, him completely ok with it). This time the dog came in for a heartworm test and vaccine, the owner refused to put a muzzle on his own pet for us (we do not typically apply muzzles when a dog is that aggressive to anyone but the owner) refused to put a muzzle on I tell him we can't see him if he will not apply the muzzle because I'm not going to risk myself or any other technicians, and I am the only male in the clinic to try to restrain the dog and we are currently understaffed so if you don't muzzle him for us we can not see him, but we are willing to try if he put it on. He does not want to put a muzzle on because ""I don't want him to remember I put a muzzle on and then hate me on the ride home"". After telling me he's not aggressive just scared I show him all the notes in the charts and he says see y'all I have seen him before I helped build this clinic I've been coming here for 25 years. After fully reviewing the chart I notice two of the doctors have already fired the client due to his aggressive pets, he just keeps coming back because people dropped the ball on noting it and didn't flag it in our computer. After explaining to him for almost an hour about our policy on aggressive pets and we are willing to try if he muzzles his pet for us. I fire him note everything in the computer, he asks for my name and manager and to see the doctors and owner of the clinic because he didn't like or think I had the authority to fire him, (the doctors and owner do not deal with angry clients and refuse to waste their time when they have other clients, so I deal with them all and even got approval from the manager, owner, and doctor on staff) leaves comes back in demanding his records because he's going somewhere else, I highlight where he has been fired twice before by two doctors (doctors that he say swears like him and he has known for 25 years). This was 2-3 months ago, he called up again yesterday to bitch about how I treated him and demands to see the owner of the practice. We suspect he went to other clinics and they turned him away or saw his old records noting how aggressive his dog is.

funny,c446nyh,"I pirated until my second ""stop that"" letter from my ISP. I have no problem pirating. In fact, I'm someone who may one day in the foreseeable future have a work that people will want to pirate. My thoughts on avoiding piracy are basically [this]( Piracy can help small publishers and self publishers as much as it can hurt.  Ink  did so well because it was pirated, and that got the word out. Half the people playing Maid RPG probably got the rules off of /tg/ before it was even finished. Then bought it anyway, because it's only 6 bucks for the pdf. 
 It is true that piracy doesn't do any real damage. Piracy doesn't take a physical copy and remove it from the seller. The idea that this happens is the thing that the MPAA and others don't seem to understand, and so they put down incredibly huge fines and penalties, including jailtime, and basically being harsher than they should. It's also this attitude that things like this mock. ""We're not  stealing , we're doing nothing wrong."" Except that that's not true. 
 Piracy steals customers, not product. People won't buy something that they can get for free. Yes, many people will use a pirated version as a full trial, and if you're an indie company, some people will even buy up multiple copies of the game, or donate to your Kickstarter. But that's not true of everyone. Many people will just pirate your game and that'll be that. Some people will pirate it and won't even  play  it. 
 It's fun to act like the MPAA is getting up in arms over nothing, and for the most part, they really are. They only care about artists who are big enough that piracy really  won't  hurt them. Piracy is quite literally just making a copy of a video tape for a few hundred thousand friends, but if you've got a copy, why buy the real one? And every artist, no matter how much you hate them but love their music or just hate them, wants credit for their work. Credit in money. Sure, a lot of people make entertainment because they want to, but people also want money. 
 The","of it is that piracy is bad. It's just that for the most part, for the big companies where the MPAA actually gets involve, it's the equivalent of jaywalking in front of a Ferrari and being real slow about it. Sure, you're holding them up, but that car goes so fast it's barely an inconvenience. It's just that in this analogy, the Ferrari is legally allowed to run you over and take your house. 
 The times that piracy actually matters don't, because the MPAA doesn't care if you pirate that Indie band's new album, or the Humble Bundle--which, by the way, most people pay only .01c for. Or pirate. It's just that because they're indie developers and some of the money goes to charity, people will pay $3500+ for four or five cell phone games. That's why the ""average"" is so small ($6.41 when I bought it last night). Because people will pay the absolute bare minimum."

 What's bad in my eyes is trying to claim that any book or teaching needs to be headed and is right only to then dismiss some parts of it because those parts are wrong.  That means if I disagree with the parts you like I am equally in the right to dismiss your parts. 
 That's the whole problem I have with religion in general, it's an insistance that ""this is the truth and we should study it"" only to then throw out the parts that aren't convenient.... 
 Well hell anyone can do that... just write a long enough book with enough stuff in it and there will be plenty of good stuff to get if you just weed out the bad. 
 What ultimatley happens is that rather than learn from a teaching, people find what they want to in the teaching and make it mean what they like it to mean.  Then they dismiss the parts they dont like and use that knowledge that the teaching is right and agrees with them as a foundation to levy any number of actions against others.

 On the way from Bend to Denver International Airport (a United hub). Unfortunately, the airport was experiencing a microbusrt. Being from the East Coast, I had no idea what that was, but after researching it, not worried about the flight. Unfortunately for the flight, we were a small plane and out of fuel, so we landed at Colorado Springs. They wouldn't let us off the plane for over an hour. Eventually our plane, and at least 4 others that stopped at Colorado Springs were allowed to fly into Denver. 
 At this point you have countless planes full of people who need new connecting flights in a mad rush.

And I thought I was sitting pretty. 
 So I stay in the airport and head over to the Delta gate. It wasn't until midnight that a gate attendant shows up. And that's when I'm informed that the flight is overbooked and chances are I wouldn't be able to get on the flight. Come 1 am, I'm still in the airport, tired, and pissed. 
 I head back to the United terminal - it is empty, and all computer kiosks are shutdown. I finally find someone for help and she just laughs at me. Tells me to go to the ticket counter for help. So I do. And it's empty! The only people there are janitors and guards. They tell me the ticket counters don't open until 6 at the earliest.

I have had ONE thing go wrong, and that was a slipped something-or-other in the shifter that prevented me from putting the car into park.

 I find it funny that people are disgusted about L-cysteine being sourced mostly from animal tissues. One of the main reasons for this is not just price: it is because people  demand  added L-cysteine to be from ""natural"" sources, rather than ""synthetic"" sources (i.e. petrochemical). 
 Gelatin is made usually from animal bones and other sources of collagen... what do people expect? Cysteine is made usually also from animal sources of protein... what do people expect? And, yes, the things that are used are mostly the discardable parts... would it make more sense to produce cysteine from meat or vegetables that could otherwise be used to feed people? 
 BTW, the main source of L-cysteine seems to be actually ""hog hair"", rather than ""human hair"", if that makes people feel any better. 
 Icky fact #43289432: ""Honey"" is actually, literally, bee vomit. Disgusting, right? 
 As a final protip: if you want to eat bread that's free from evil evil food additives, it might make sense to buy your bread in a bakery (or make it yourself), rather than to buy whatever passes off as ""bread"" in a supermarket.",I can understand that it's disgusting if a bread factory is sourcing their ingredients/additives from a place with no hygiene or quality control. I can't understand what's disgusting about a bread factory using properly purified L-cysteine that has been sourced from hair (or any other animal tissue). Humans eat animals and animal by-products; people should be able to get over it.
funny,c5awlu1,"I actually hydroplaned not to long ago on Jun 30th in my mother's BMW Z4. I was doing somewhere between 65-70mph in the far left lane of a 5 lane highway (64E in NC, speed limit 65). It wasn't raining but it had apparently poured buckets ahead of us and the road turned from dry to puddle creating wet within a couple hundred feet. I was going around a slight right hand corner that happened to also be at the crest of a rise in the road. (now the good stuff) 
 When I saw the puddles in the road, mind you it was midnight, I reached for the cruise control to turn it off and as soon as I did, the car decelerated at the same time I went through a puddle and the traction control pulsed and shot the back end of the car around to the right (I don't think it's supposed to work that way...). I was sideways before I could even react and counter steer + brake. At that time I just slammed my foot down on the brakes as we slid across and in front of many other cars also doing the speed limit. Right before we stopped we ended up tapping a car that was in the far right lane sending it spinning. We stopped on the shoulder facing traffic (damn near perfectly parked). 
 No injuries and thankfully very little car damage. A scrape along the front fender across the emblem for her car, a small dent in the quarter panel of the other car. I was held responsible and I take blame for the incident but it was due to a hydroplane, something I hadn't experienced yet in my 18 years of driving so far.","I was sideways before I could even react and at that point I just slammed on the brakes.

No major conversation, just asking a question, a response, and maybe me commenting on how I mean to try it (usually I really am, not bullshitting around). Or hell, even just ""so how's your weekend?"" or ""how's your day been?"". It's a simple question to break the ice and be friendly. 
 From what I can see, the majority of Redditors tend to be overly shy, so when a cashier even asks ""how was your day"" the response in their mind is something along the lines of ""LOL WTF LEAVE ME ALONE JUST LET ME BUY MY STUFF STOP TRYING TO CONVERSE WITH ME WEIRDO"". I really don't get the hate for cashiers trying to make conversation here. I'm willing to bet any Redditor who's ever been a bagger or cashier would understand better. 
 Unless those comments they make here are bullshit and meant to just be humorous more than realistic. Because I'm positive some of the people I converse with are redditors, and we tend to meet on common ground with something. Are those the same people who go home and make an image macro about how they hate cashiers talking to them? .. 
 Anyway, we're  encouraged  to talk to customers. If we become friendly with customers, perhaps even remember their name or at least their face (so next time they come we can say hi again, in a ""we remember you"" way), they tend to be repeat customers.

 I was in student leadership and we were organizing a school talent show. A girl in leadership and I were tasked with going to the choir room and inviting the choir members to participate. The girl I was paired with was a cheerleader, and since it was a game day, she was in her uniform. 
 When we made the announcement to the choir, several girls rolled their eyes and made snarky comments about the ""freakin' cheerleader."" She was shocked, and I was pissed. They had made a snap judgement about this girl based on what she was wearing and an activity she participated in. 
 The thing is, this girl was incredibly sweet and kind. I'd never heard her say anything bad about anyone, and she typically went out of her way to be nice to those on the fringes of the social pool. Unfortunately, ours was a large school and none of these bitchy choir girls knew her, but they saw that she was a cheerleader and apparently that was enough for them. 
 I later confronted one of the girls about it, but she refused to feel guilty.

 Blanks mind you were around 7 bux each at this time, and the machines were notorious for failing out on finalizing the disk.  So you can imagine the roulette game you played every time you got to the end of a 42 minute burn and prayed that the disk actually spit out alright.

 > No registrant, as defined in KRS 17.500... 
 So we turn to [17.500]( 
 > ""Registrant"" means:
> (a) Any person eighteen (18) years of age or older at the time of the offense
> or any youthful offender, as defined in KRS 600.020, who has committed:
> 1. A sex crime; or
> 2. A criminal offense against a victim who is a minor; or
> (b) Any person required to register under KRS 17.510; or
> (c) Any sexually violent predator; or
> (d) Any person whose sexual offense has been diverted pursuant to KRS
> 533.250, until the diversionary period is successfully completed;

funny,chwzgwy,"America First was not a NAZI organization.  It was an isolationist movement that opposed moving towards what some believed and an increasingly inevitable war.  They were, perhaps, willfully ignorant of the atrocities occurring in Europe and Asia, and were of the assumption that aiding the Allied nations by providing goods and weapons would only serve to involve the country in a war they had no business being in, and would weaken the countries own defensive capabilities.  They utilized propaganda as much as those who believed war was inevitable. 
 One major figure in the campaign was Charles Lindbergh, who was a speaker for the America First issue.  The Roosevelt administration defamed Lindbergh and utilized that fact that lindbergh has received a medal from Hitler in the 1930's as a way to weaken the cause to turn public opinion towards war readiness, but he was not a literal NAZI (Although Roosevelt seemed to have felt a strong bit of antipathy towards Lindbergh due to the America First Campaign and can be quoted as believing Lindbergh a NAZI) .  Upon the entry into the war, Lindbergh supported the war effort and despite being barred from being recommissioned in the military, found work in the Aviation industry with aircraft testing and design.  He would also fly many combat missions as a civilian. 
 Do not, however, take this to mean the Lindbergh did not have racist ideas, which were common at the time.  It is fairly clear that he believed in some anti-semitic and racist ideas, and was a subscriber to the not unpopular idea of voluntary eugenics amongst his peers.  His father was a washington senator who believed in phrenology and social darwinism and upon his fame, lindbergh ran with the likes of Henry Ford and others whose views are also controversial.  He was very much a product of his times, and his views cannot be blamed anymore than they can be denied, I suppose. 
 Back to the point: America First was an anti-war campaign and not a collection of NAZI sympathizers.  Anti-Semitic and Xenophobic views found within it are the same ones that can be seen throughout america at the time, and their arguments were not founded upon supporting Hitler, but on avoiding involvement.","America First was not a NAZI organization, this guy is wrong."

 I've got a short story about public intoxication: 
 Once a year we're a group of students who buy a 24-hour train ticket and just ride around Copenhagen, drinking as we go. We usually do this as kind of a scavenger hunt. 
 So a couple of years ago we're on our way to our second stop. We need to go to this one train station, which is in two stories, and take the elevator from the top to the ground floor, taking pictures as we ride it (It's a glass elevator). 
 We're probably 7 or 8 people and the elevator clearly states a maximum capacity of 12, so we are good to go, everybody inside. We ride it down, yelling, singing, drinking all of that and when we get to the ground floor the doors open and we yell ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"", then shut the doors again, to go back up. We only get like a meter or two and the elevator gets stuck. 
 So there we are, 7-8 people stuck in a tiny elevator, all drunk or going on to be at least. We laugh it off at first, but when the emergency button doesn't do anything we start to panic a bit. Thankfully it's a glass elevator, so we wave at people below, gesticulating that we are stuck. They all saw us getting down to the ground floor, so they all just shake their heads and minds their own business. Now we really start to panic. Having been drinking all day without peeing, a couple of us are thinking about how that it going to play out. 
 All of a sudden the emergency button works. A voice is booming, not inside the elevator, but all over the entire train station: ""You, in the elevator. What are you doing?"". One of the guys take the lead and says into the microphone: ""Well, we're stuck in this here elevator."", he mumbles a bit, probably because of the alcohol. The voice booms over the train station again: ""How many are you in there?"" We reply: ""7^((or 8)^) "". ""And how many people can the elevator carry?"" (Right about now we are looking weird at each other, WTF is going on here, stupid questions) ""Umm, it's a 12 person elevator. Can you come get us out?"". ""Yeah, yeah"" the voice booms again, ""We'll send somebody, but it might take a couple of hours"". After that we hear what must have been a phone getting hung up. 
 A couple of hours! Thankfully just three train conductors come wandering down the stairs, see us and starts gesticulating wether we are stuck or something. ""We are in fact stuck, yes, please come save us"" one of the guys manage to wave back. The three of them find a key for the elevator. The key can apparently be used to get the elevator to go to the ground floor. We all cheer once we get there, only to realise that the key won't open the elevator doors. We try and try with our fingers to split the door, however in the end one of the conductors go fetch a screwdriver, which he pries in the door and gets us out. 
 The first thing they say to us, once we get out of the elevator, and can talk again is: ""Why would you ride 7^((or 8)^) people in that eleva... are you guys drunk?"" To which one of the guys reply: ""Of course we are! And since we got stuck in your elevator, we want compensation."". The first conductor just goes: ""Umm... no."" whilst one of the other goes: ""Okay. Where are you guys headed, I'll tag along and get this sorted out"". 
 We get into the next train and tell him that we're going in to the centre of Copenhagen to count the colours on a theatre called Palace. He just chuckles and goes: ""Hmm, you'd probably want to go grab some sandwiches whilst there, right?"". He hands us free tickets to the train as well and calling for another guy to pick us up at the station and give us sandwiches. He then goes: ""Hmm... wait a minute? I thought you guys were drinking, yet I haven seen a single can of beer yet, what's up with that?"". We tell him that we thought it was illegal to consume alcohol on the train, to which he only gets to pronounce the ""N"" in ""No"" before we all have a half drunk can of beer in our hands again. He just smiles at us and wishes us a pleasant trip.

 I'll give you a hint -- it's less than some administrators, who do a fraction of the work of a professor, and generate no societal benefit at all.

At least in American research universities, the real reason that professors are kept around at all is to attract grant funding and corporate ""partnerships"" so that the university cna build more shiny new (empty) buildings and attract more donors. 
 Teaching has relatively little to do with promotions in many programs, although you wouldn't know it from the way that corporatized universities gouge their students.

funny,c1htugn,"Well, I think this one is actually pretty deep. Think of all the primeval creatures, savage, cunning, and ferocious. 
 Those animals have been all but wiped out by human predation, replaced by enormous domestic animal populations that are timid, dumb, and subservient. 
 Have you looked at a puppy, the way it can't contain happiness, rolling around and yelping and shit, at the slightest sign of affection? How can an animal be that pathetic? I think it's pretty degrading to the species as a whole. We've imposed on them the worst kind of enslavement, by breeding infantile features into our pets. It's creepy. 
 Good commentary. 
 I decided to expand upon this because everyone is latching onto my puppy example. Want different examples of animals we've emasculated utterly? What about our food source? Consider the cow, which are systematically milked (both absurd and grotesque, in my opinion, that we keep cows expressly to obtain their lactation intended for their own young), or the hog, which were bred specifically to eat anything and grow as fat as possible (hog competitions and shit take the absurdity of humans 'playing god' to a new, disturbing level). How about not cute puppies but bulldogs, who can barely breathe? The beloved Golden Retriever, which often live out their entire lives with crippled hips as a result of extensive inbreeding responsible for that golden fur? 
 Remember who killed off the mammoths. The sabertooths. Replaced them with docile grazers that do little more than produce meat their entire lives. More recently, even highly evolutionarily successful species--wolves, bears, eagles--are under the threat of extinction. It's because man cannot find better use for these proud, majestic creatures who once vied for the top spot in the planet's food chain. 
 Survival of the fittest indeed--but which of you can claim that the savage nature of these predators is not inspirational, impressive? We are losing some of the most valuable resources on the planet--biological diversity. And for what? In the name of practicality? So we don't have to deal with ferocious animals, just tame, brain-dead, dependent animals? So we can take them into space? Domesticated animals aren't really animals--they are extensions of the human consciousness. We've bred into them our ways of thinking and our culture. And yes, by being assimilated as a human slave-species, they've weaseled into evolutionary success. So? You are not an animal lover because you have twelve cats or three crippled dogs. In fact, if anything, having pets is ethically questionable, and just because it's so widely accepted doesn't mean it's not absurd--because it really is, and it's a cruel subversion of a competitor--which are what different types of animals are in the first place. 
 Next time you're on a farm, look into the eyes of a bovine meat-machine. See if you can detect even a hint of the glory that was their ancestors. Or even a spark of life. These beasts were dead since they were born, and they patiently await their own massacre without a feeling or a thought. But yeah, these features make them practical. What really bothers me is that we actually achieved all this by breeding in infantile features (strangely akin to what we are doing to our own pop culture, but I digress). We've scored an ultimate victory against our foes-of-yesterday, and it distresses me that it was our natural inclination (after all, there is  probably  no global conspiracy against non-human predators) to sabotage them in this vicious, pitiless way. And all we have more than them, is just a little more brain mass. 
 I hunt. I don't hunt for every meal, but I hunt because it's an experience incomparable to any other, to see an animal actually give a damn about TRYING TO SURVIVE. There's something so noble and also humbling about that. Seeing that, it makes me want to be a better person, more than anything.","Don't support factory farms and conventional grocery stores.

near the end of the great coach-wagon age. The friends and scoundrels
he keeps company with during his travels are sketched out so well that these characters take on the very faces of those you know. 
 If you take the time to enjoy this short story from Roughing It,
you'll be all the richer for it:

funny,c2jltb0,"Oh, its good we are going there with what field we're in. Let me introduce myself. I work with steel daily. Let's just say, I don't have a degree in metallurgy, but I do interact with metal on a daily basis at a molecular level dealing with grains and hardness of said material. I program 5 axis mills with some pretty crazy exotic alloys. For proper cutting I must know about what i'm cutting from the hardness, grain quality, melting point, ect... So your experience fighting fires in what is mostly (only guessing here) non steel structures must trump anything I'm about to say here. So I will be clear and to the point and get out of this pissing match as quickly as possible. Steel needs in all cases, a fire fed by some sort of accelerant to melt. Usually 1800+F but higher on more robust types. My point is, the majority of the jet fuel burned up in a flash fire. A hot, low smoke flash fire. There was none left. The fire that remained had dark, thick smoke. This is an indicator of a low temperature fire being fed by carpet, paper, and wood. Not enough to melt steel. Even in a controlled environment. The fact the building survived the initial impact proved its integrity and it would have remained standing. They did not fall on their own. Witnesses testified to hearing bombs going off. I'm not crazy, for every example supporting your view by nameless studies or witnesses, I can pull something just as silly in your eyes off the internet and post it up in retort. So I wont get in a link war either","the fires were far too ""cold"" 3 buildings. Its quite silly to think otherwise"

Although I doubt your most ecumenical descriptivist would be able to articulate a mechanism for differentiating misuses from genuine instances of language change, such a mechanism clearly exists tacitly.

funny,c9ug4gw,"Yes, I understand your point, but like you said yourself, I already explicitly listed schools. 
 I also want to repeat that I'm talking about ""piece of cake""  in relation to other schools . That doesn't mean it's easy. Yes. Getting a degree at most universities will be very hard. Regardless whether they are ivy league or not. You have to study a fuckton and won't have a social life if you want good grades. That's how university works. 
 I already had this conversation a few times so some of this will be copy&pasted, so don't mind the wall of text if you don't actually care that much about the topic: 
 My point is that people seem to believe that education at ivy league universities somehow is better than anywhere else. Which is simply nonsense. To illustrate that point: Physics won't get easier/harder depending on where you are. Learning about electrodynamics at the MIT won't teach you any more/less about it in a class at TU Vienna (actually, I can attest that the subject material in Vienna is harder... and from an international perspective nobody fucking knows that university). 
 The important part is that you most likely will get much more support by your teachers at the MIT (which will make passing those classes and therefore getting your degree easier). 
 So... the lectures are highly irrelevant (except you literally have a genius of teaching such as Walter Lewin, which makes the lecture itself already so rewarding to participate in that I would pay just to sit in that class for entertainment value, but that really is an exception). 
 The point is that ivy league  education  itself isn't ""better"" than any other serious university's education. Passing courses at Harvard doesn't necessarily make you smarter or more hardworking than getting the same grades at some other institution. In some cases quite the opposite. When I was studying in Korea I met quite a lot of people from quite a lot of schools in Seoul. Korea University is considered the second best university in Korea (for that place it competes with Yonsei). However, it isn't the hardest one. 
 I had a normal workload comparable to my workload at home in Vienna, Austria. To illustrate: To get a 3.0 GPA you need about 8 hours a day, smart people will get better grades with that and to be at the top of the class you need to invest some more. Students from other universities in Korea were pulling off 16 hour work days. They got up at 6AM then went to university until 3PM, then spent the rest of their day studying at home. And these weren't ""I am an honors student and need perfect grades!"" type of people. That was just normal for them. When they went out they said things like ""I have two hours for going out today, no, please no alcohol."" 
 To add another school to the discussion: I never had an MIT-experience myself but I have many friends in cognitive science who went to that school and they attest that they worked MUCH less than that and partied quite a lot and had a lot of time for extracurricular activities (which I heard are awesome at the MIT).","I didn't try to say that people at ivy league universities are lazy or worse than students of other schools. Of course getting a degree there is hard. The point is that it's just as hard (or in some cases even harder) as getting a degree at some cheapass school in the middle of nowhere. 
 Personal question: Where did you go to school?"
funny,c5t20cu,"Just to rain on your parade a bit. 
 Slower isn't always safer. Civil War era projectiles traveled much, much slower and wreaked terrible damage upon impact (but they were also entirely different shapes, sizes, weights, etc.). Also, slower moving bullets can have more stopping power. 
 Often Haji didn't even notice he had been hit by 5.56mm rounds fired from Coalition forces in Iraq, for example, because they traveled so fast that they zipped right through.","a slower traveling can inflict less damage, but not always.

I was working construction at this time (2008), and knew a niche trade very well.   I took the seed money from the sale of my forums and started an e-com site offering my knowledge and the product (product is not cheap) and also bought some bitcoins and litecoins (myself and two others have been blamed for single handedly crashing litecoin due to me having an issue with buying a house:   ) when they were in their infancy.

 An increased American military presence at the prospect of Korean unification would be a change of degree, and not of kind; though the Chinese may not like some of the implications of  more  American military presence, it’s not something that doesn’t already exist, and the reality is that there’s been no  new  set of options for China in Korea since the rapid increase in industrialization of the PRC that occurred in the middle of the 1980’s. 
 There’s just the one option, ultimately, for China: a deep and unadulterated support for reunification that looks more like the South Korea of today than anything else; it’s the sole desired outcome of the insatiable beast that is the global economy, and China is a player that can’t begin to leave that game without causing deep harm to itself.

 Say it's Monday and you paid $3 each to rent the three movies for a three-day period. You have until closing time on Thursday to return them (officially, technically if they were scanned in by opening Thursday they wouldn't be late). $9 for three days. 
 If they weren't scanned in by the time the store opened on Thursday the systems would automatically re-rent them to you for the same period of time. So now you have until Sunday to return them, you just pay the $9 rental fee after they're returned. 
 If you returned your three movies two days late like you said, on Saturday, you'd still only have the $9 fee. If you returned them two days after your ""new due date"" (Sunday), which would end up being Tuesday, you'd owe $18. 
 I was a manager for seven years. Three movies would never rack up a late fee that large if they were returned within 90 days of the original rental date. Other chains may have been slightly different, but there is no way a movie would be written off after being less than 30 days late. Even then, the movies would no longer show as outstanding on your account, you'd simply owe the cost of the actual dvds plus an estimate of what the store lost by not having them available to rent (it's been a while but I'd estimate that typically a single new release that got written off would leave a $50 charge on the account). 
 Write-offs wouldn't get sent to collections until they sat on the account unpaid for a year. Numerous phone calls would be made and letters mailed (this would be automated and done out of a corporate location). 
If the collection agency was able to make contact with you I guarantee Blockbuster would have first. 
 What actually happened here was either: 
 
 Your three movies were never actually returned and you ignored Blockbuster's attempts to contact you about it, so they sent it off to collections. 
 
 You were the victim of a very unlikely misfortune in which all three of your movies didn't get scanned in upon their return, or during category changes, or during inventory, or when changing them over from rental to sale dvds, or when the store liquidated and sold everything. One movie would be unlikely but not impossible. But all three from the same person? 
 
 You were the victim of a company employee using store records to access customer addresses to pose as a collection agency. 
 
 You're remembering everything about this incorrectly. 
 
 You flat out made this up.","I shouldn't care but in the near decade I worked managing video rentals I had to deal with people spreading bullshit about the way we handled late fees. This person either never returned their movies or they're full of shit.

funny,cacox7l,"My wife used to be really bad about getting mad at me over something, but not telling me what. 
 Of course...since I had no idea what was pissing her off I just kept doing it and she kept getting more angry.  I'd ask what I was doing and she would just say ""nothing"".  I pointed out a few times that that was terrible communication and that it was just going to end in her blowing up...but that was a bad move because it would just piss her off more. 
 I finally figured out what worked and she now almost never does this.  If she's obviously angry and won't tell me why...then I just do whatever the hell I want.  I don't try to cater to her, I go out and do what I feel like at that time (usually means avoiding her).  This of course...pissed her off.  But here's the other part of it, I made a rule that if she blows up because she refused to tell me what I was doing before it became a big deal, then I don't apologize.  it doesn't matter if I was actually in the wrong or not, if she makes a big deal out of something like that then she will never get an apology for what I did.  I told her that as part of the conversation when I finally decided on my course of action. 
 She did it a few more times after that, I consistently reacted in the same way every time.  See she's getting mad, ask her what's wrong, have her say nothing, tell her I can see that she's pissed at me and remind her that whatever is pissing her off is going to continue unless she tells me, then just go and do whatever I want. 
 once the blowup happens, the only reaction she gets is ""ya, you should have told me that in the first place and I would have stopped, then we'd never have had this argument"".  Repeat it a few times and in the end she apologizes to me, and I stop doing whatever it was that was pissing her off. 
 Now, when this happens...she either tells me what's upsetting her, or doesn't let it get her more upset until she's ready to communicate.  In the end, the big fights were just getting her upset and they weren't really impacting me at all because I wouldn't let them get to me...so she stopped because they no longer gained her anything and in fact made more stress for her. 
 Edit: I feel obligated to edit this because a bunch of people say they are going to use this.  Keep in mind that everyone is different...both you and your girlfriend/wife.  Also, relationships are different.  I have a history of constant honesty and communication, this has fostered a relationship where more harsh feedback such as above can be accepted (or anger it induces forgiven) because she understands who I am and how I communicate, and we have a relationship that is based on more direct communication.  I will admit that this part of the relationship is likely induced by my communication methods because I insist on the need for that in a relationship to work with me, and she found it acceptable and communicated that by continuing the relationship with me.  Also, she is a very fair minded person (when not upset, we all tend to not be fair minded if we're angry), so when she was cooled off she generally agreed that it wasn't fair to get mad at me for something she never explained.  This made her more willing to accept what I was doing in reaction to the arguments. 
 edit","this may not work for you if your relationship is different than ours...and it may piss her (or him) off...a lot. 
 Edit 2: I would also like to note that this isn't a male/female thing (since many replies seem to assume it is).  This is a human thing.  We all do it to some degree, it works for some and doesn't work for others.  I know men that do this exact same thing.  Also, there's nothing inherently wrong with pondering over something before you communicate with someone, there's also nothing wrong with not telling a person right away why you're angry...the only time it becomes an issue is if you continue to hold the behavior against the person and allow yourself to become angrier without ever giving them a chance to correct whatever it is that's upsetting you."

 In that MMO, do people's avatars not have genders? Or is it just that so many men play female characters that you assume everyone is male? 
 And are you telling me it's never the case that a character is revealed to be female for some other reason, and is treated poorly because of that? Because the females themselves tell us differently, and they are more in a position to know. 
 Yes, they  are  more in a position to know. Males are in fact still privileged in society, which means we can ignore sexism to a degree females can't. 
 > Fuck that, why should females be held to a different standard? 
 I wasn't suggesting they should. Such a person might be cut some slack for being a newbie, but not for being a female. 
 > You are a person on the internet, the only way to judge you is by your behavior. 
 Again, this is how you would  like  it to be. You're not hearing the part where this is not actually what's going on. In fact, I'll bet even people like you who would like to believe that you're ""just a person"" actually do interact with people as if they were male, and do harbor a subconscious assumption that they are. 
 That's not your fault. We're wired to do that. Humans are simply not wired to see a person as ""just a person"" without a gender. Hell, we even assign gender to inanimate objects, like ships and planes! 
 > You know why people are called fags? They acted like a faggot, and I don't mean they sucked a dick. 
 And this is fucking disgusting, that you would take a word that is actually a description of someone's sexual orientation, and associate it with things you consider to be bad. 
 This is assuming people don't bring up the ""sucked a dick"" part, and I call bullshit on that. When this kind of shit comes up, it's rarely just ""You're a fag"" or ""You're so gay"", it quite often goes further than that, like talking about how much this person likes men, how many cocks they've sucked, etc. Other homophobic language is used the same way -- you're particularly annoyed at someone for killing you the n-th time, so you don't call them ""gay"" or a ""fag"", but maybe you say something like ""Eat a dick!""

funny,c89tnh1,"I feel that Futurama and media like it give a twisted, biased, unfair impression of Nixon's accomplishments and personality... and I'm all for it. 
 Nixon accomplished a great deal during his presidency. He improved relations with China and Russia during a time when that just didn't seem doable, he signed into law the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Vietnam war ended on his watch (although how much credit he deserves for each of these is certainly debatable), and he even tried to implement health reforms that are in some ways similar to what Obama finally accomplished with the ACA (though Nixon also advocated for HMOs, despite that he acknowledged it resulting in less care given to patients so that private entities could profit). 
 Some on the right seek to highlight Nixon's admittedly notable accomplishments and minimize his failings, but thanks to popular entertainment like Futurama, that just isn't happening. Everyone remembers Nixon as the guy who doth protest too much when growling ""I am not a crook!"" (which incidentally had nothing to do with Watergate), the guy quick to anger, who kept a list of enemies, and who cheated the system even when he didn't need to. 
 It's not entirely fair... but it shouldn't be. The presidency is the highest office in the land, a symbol meant to be a guiding beacon for our populace. Theoretically, it is a position to be reserved for our best, our brightest, our most honest and pure (though of course we all know that human nature makes such an expectation unrealistically optimistic). And when the president does something less than admirable, he shames us as a nation, and that shame should taint his name throughout history. 
 This is why, despite Nixon's accomplishments, it is fitting that he will likely be forever remembered as a mean-spirited, scheming crook. Just as Clinton will undoubtedly be remembered for his infidelity and Bush Jr. will surely be remembered for his stupidity. And while Obama's opponents desperately try to pin him as one cartoon character or another, none of these seem to be sticking, likely because despite that he's only human and certainly isn't without his failings, he has generally maintained the integrity of the position he represents.","Nixon may have been a good president, and accomplished some great things... but fuck him.

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. 
 > In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127),  science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name —for a laboratory manager position.  Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant.  These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. 
 > The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses , such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that  the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent . We also assessed faculty participants’ preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. 
 >These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.","Applications with identical qualifications

 ""Female"" applicants were rated as less competent and less suitable than ""male"" applicants 
 ""Male"" applicants offered higher salary than ""females"", more career mentoring"
funny,cq5ef9g,"There are a lot of different interpretations that you could apply to this passage of scripture. All the laws that the Jewish people constantly had to adhere to were made to show them that everyone fell short of the glory of God. There was no way that everybody could live up to all the ridiculous rules, and this showed that, as mortals, everyone was unfit to be in the presence of God. That's some pretty heavy stuff. So heavy, that groups like the pharisees were created as a form of elitism in the Jewish sect, so people could point out the sins of others instead of acknowledging their own. But then Jesus showed up, and fulfilled the law by coming to Earth as the Messiah and sacrificing himself for our sins as was promised in several parts throughout the old testament. He fulfilled the law by paying the ransom for all the sins against God thee world committed, and then coming out the other side on top. This made it possible to gain direct access to God by merely believing in Jesus.","The law still exists, and causes spiritual death to those who don't have faith in Jesus, but Jesus's grace covers those who do."
funny,c5dpisv,"How to judge the weather by numbers is somehow just a thing to get used to, especially since fahrenheit or celsius both can't give a good prediction (the same number can feel different, when there is rain, wind, muggy or dry air). 
 The thing about the fahrenheit scale is: its pretty much outdated. (like all other non SI units).
The point of SI units (aswell as Celsius) is: they are meant to be measured/calibrated easily, so everyone can reproduce the same number. Initially Fahrenheit has been defined in a way, which can't be reproduced easily. 
 (an average coldest day or the human body temperature is NOT a good way to define a scale/unit, as bad as a human foot; reason: differences in humans, variance in time) 
 Today Fahrenheit is defined by freezing and boiling water, similar to Celsius. (note: definition of Celsius has been changed slightly, so that 273.15°K = 0°C, so it's easy to translate into the SI unit Kelvin aswell) 
 BTW: it's actually pretty interesting how the SI-unit system evolved/still evolves. For example, the definition of 1kg mass has yet to be defined in a satisfactory manner. Older definitions use special ""calibration masses"" (also called ""original masses"", used to make new copies) which can gain or lose a tiny bit of mass over time, even while locked away. It's quite tricky to solve this problem (as far as i know, it is not solved yet, because of the high expectations in accuracy for the new definition)","It's easier and probably more accurate to define/calibrate a temperature via Celsius than via Fahrenheit, since Fahrenheits definition is outdated. Same goes for other SI-units: definition/calibration is of great importance in science! Also the kilogram is still a problem."

funny,c65dzis,"The vast majority of the stars we see in the night sky with the naked eye are within our own galactic arm, meaning they are within a few thousand light years (likely much closer). No individual star outside of our own galaxy can shine bright enough to be seen from a few million light years, and even stars on the far side of our galaxy can't be individually resolved withiout a powerful telescope -- Think how we see the neighboring arms of the galaxy as a milky fog on the sky. Any objects we see at that distance are entire galaxies (i.e. the Andromeda galaxy which is approximately 2.5 million LY from here). Comparing a few thousand years to the life span of a star, which can be upwards of 10 billion years, is hardly a comparison at all. The chances that the star you are looking at died in the past thousand years are minuscule (~1/10,000,000).

funny,ce5ib67,"I deeply enjoy philosophy, but even I can admit there is a rampant amount of BS. Philosophy in education is more about  discussing  the problems than making any attempt to solve them. The 'greats' so to speak all tried in ernest, and may have even succeeded, in answering some of our most deep seated questions, but we don't follow suit so much nowadays. Douglas Adams was not far from the mark in Hitchiker's Guide. During the construction of Deep Thought and the plan to answer 'life the universe and everything', the philosophers object, claiming they won't be able to make a livelihood if anyone ever actually answers those questions. 
 I suppose what I'm trying to say is, philosophy is objectively an incredibly important and enriching subject, but the majority of its supporters really are pretentious arseholes content with batting about subjects to their own misguided satisfactions. I remember one of my tutors discussed the universal constants with us one lesson, and how they fit into theological arguments, and then in another lesson discussed Plato's theory of forms. Plato's entire argument hinges on nothing in our material plain being static and unchanging, and yet that is exactly what the universal constants are. I very much doubt even Plato would defend his argument given the scientific advances we have today, and yet many people still bat about the forms like it has any credence at all. Even in philosophy a hypothesis can fail, we need to stop pretending otherwise or else it will just become endless BS.","Philosophy is a science that has stop being treated like a science, and so is rapidly becoming rampant bullshit.

funny,c8t20yo,"I guess you have to decide the point at which you start blaming someone for the way they are. You can argue that pretty much any negative characteristic can be traced back to either nature or nurture. It's also tricky to assign a time in a person's life where they have to start taking responsibility for the way they are. I mean, do you wake up one day and suddenly gain the ability to undo all the negative parts of your nature that you've acquired or started out with? Surely, the more messed up you are, the less likely you ever are to gain this ability to reflect and self modify? 
 Also, who wakes up and thinks ""I'm gonna be an asshole."" And if they do, isn't the very act of doing that indicative that they were  already  an asshole by just thinking that? 
 I've always thought that hating on people is, in principle, less of a comment on whether it's ""their fault"" that they're the way they are, and more to do with the hater just not wanting to put up with the way the asshole is, regardless of whose ""fault"" it is that they're like that.

funny,c7v4jfv,"I know this is r/funny and not medicine or askscience but I just really don't like misinformation being propagated with such confidence. Just to explain why what you're saying doesn't make sense (for the sake of education and not to argue or shame you) I'll do a quick explanation of anatomy/physiology re: Viagra/Revatio. 
 The drug essentially works by dilating blood vessels by targeting an enzyme that isn't present in all blood vessels, but happens to be present both in lung and penis blood vessels. Dilation in the penis allows for an erection. The extra ""draw"" of blood to the penis would be a small fraction, certainly well under 10% of all systemic circulation. 
 But why, might you ask, did I just use the phrase""systemic circulation,"" couldn't I just have said ""circulation."" This is because mammalian blood circulation is essentially two systems. There is the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation. The human heart can almost be thought of as two separate pumps, there is the right heart which pumps blood to the lungs, and the left heart which gathers all the blood that just went through the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body, including the penis, that blood then returns to the right heart and continues the process. 
 Since blood flow is really just a closed system of pumps and tubes, in any given minute, an equal amount of blood must go through the lungs as the amount that goes through the rest of the body. The small amount of blood flow increase to the penis with viagra can steal some blood from the brain or kidneys or muscle or gut, but cannot decrease pulmonary circulation. 
 Also, since the pulmonary circulation is an independent system, Revatio dilating the blood vessels in the lungs isn't actually going to ""draw off"" blood from anywhere, all it will do in decrease the blood pressure in the lungs. This is why Revatio is used to treat ""pulmonary hypertension"" or high blood pressure in the lungs. 
 Huge caveat, for the sake of ease of explanation I excluded a bunch of intricacies of neonatal anatomy and circulation that could make my pulmonary vs systemic circulation division less clear cut, but for the purposes of this discussion can be left out.","Revatio does not allow for more blood to be drawn to the lungs, it simply decreases lung blood pressure, there is still plenty of blood for boners."

 OP, Tupac was never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever convicted of Rape. He was charged, tried and found  innocent. 
 Ergo: You are retarded. 
 Tupac was charged and tried for rape. During the trial due to no DNA evidence, any forced entry evidence, and conflicting statements from the ""victim"", he was found not guilty of rape. However, Tupac did state at one point during his encounter with her that day he did grab her ass. When asked did he ask her permission, he stated that since they where in a previous relationship days earlier, he didn't assume he had to. He unwillingly admitted possible sexual assault, and was sentenced to four years on that. But not a convicted rapist. 
 While serving 8 months of his harsh 4 year sentence, it emerged that evidence was hidden from the defense. One part of the evidence was a voice mail recording of the ""victim"" leaving a sexually explicit message on his phone.

 I didn't get the impression that GP was asserting that ""power plays"" are the only approach women ever apply to sex.

 It is however categorically true that women and men approach sex differently. Most men have a relatively hard time conceiving of reasons for sex besides as an end in itself. Indeed, this is programmed into or evolutionary biology. Some say as a mechanism to allow women to control men (and influence them to stick around). From the perspective of successful reproduction, a woman who is incapacitated from reproduction while bearing a child to term and from hunting while nurturing one has good reason to value the man for reasons other than sex, and to use sex to secure those things. Loyalty, food, protection... females who could barter sex for these things had a better chance of surviving offspring.

He and I must have played with every damned thing in the shop before I finally made a selection, and when we got back to my house, my mother could only roll her eyes at the fact that I'd been gifted both a new sword  and  a gun. 
 The thing is, having grown up in that environment, I didn't realize that ""gay"" or ""straight"" were distinctions that anyone needed to make.

 ""Oh, uh, well..."" my mother stammered, glancing towards the front of the car. ""Well, it... it means  happy! "" 
 I furrowed my brow. ""'Happy?'"" I repeated. ""What? That's it?"" 
 ""There's also a flower called 'gay!'"" my mother declared. 
 This new knowledge did very little to allay my confusion. ""So... Anthony is a  flower? "" 
 ""Anthony who?"" asked my mother. ""From your class?"" 
 I nodded enthusiastically. ""Yeah! He's gay, but I don't know why that's bad."" 
 ""It  isn't  bad!"" Once more, my mother looked at the driver's seat, this time with an apologetic smile. ""We'll talk more about it when we get home."" 
 After a couple of hours, the car trip - which I'm sure I'd made awkward for everyone - was finally at an end. We bid my ""uncles"" goodbye, and then my mother ushered me into the family room for a serious talk.

 ""... Yes?"" I answered. (By that point, I was more interested in eating the saltwater taffy that had been purchased for me during our outing.)

 So why are features being cut? Because the cost of producing content in general is ballooning. Look at some of the material that has come out so far for Battlefront. That blaster pistol probably has more detail in it than all the character models in Battlefront 2 put together. A single character model, weapons included, might have as much detail as half a battlefront 2 map. They've got to pay people to do that, and the demand for detail is increasing much quicker than increases in the productivity of art creation tools. 
 You used to be able to have a character artist that knocked out all of the character models in a game. Now you need an entire team of character artists just to work on some of the more important characters. This translates into dollars, lots and lots of dollars. And that's just art, the same extends to programming and content scripting as well. Everything is way more complex than it used to be. This object has to behave differently depending on what caliber of bullet struck it. We need to make sure the physics simulation on these plants behaves reasonably when they get blown across the map by a rocket. This is all stuff that didn't used to matter at all, but now is taken for granted and expected in modern games. 
 So where it used to be that 50 million dollars would get you so much content with so many game modes, that now has been cut down dramatically. The cost of each individual bit of content has skyrocketed to the point where the same amount of money won't get you remotely as far. Features that are less popular are going to be hacked off, and maybe added back on as DLC, because DLC expands the budget and lets these features pay for themselves.","Games are getting more compact and focused because the amount of money it costs to produce content is growing faster than the amount of revenue generated by any given game. If you want content, it has to be paid for somehow. DLC is likely to be that somehow."
funny,c66k7in,"See these people are downvoting you, because you are presenting a different opinion on things. Don't feel bad brother, you're fighting the good fight. The world would be boring if everyone had a logical way of doing things. There is a language of symbols that people use in astrology. It doesn't mean it has anything to do with reality, but it still cool to dabble in. 
 I spent lots of nights hanging with ""different"" types, and I respect them as something different. People on here are fucking hypocrites. They talk about how religious people shove their beliefs down peoples throats, then turn around, and shoot someone down, because they have a different opinion. 
 Just because it ""can't"" be true, doesn't mean you should try to bury it. Everything we know will be obsolete in 100 years. It sounds impossible, but it will. I don't believe in astrology, but keep an objective view of reality. I fully accept the possibility of a deeper reality. 
 The problem isn't what people believe, its the extent to which they resist change. Astrology might not be real, but it is an evolving notion that encompasses something different then the logical way of dealing with things. Modern astrology is more about symbolism, and loose association then destiny.  It allows you to convey ideas, and articulate thought from an artistic perspective. 
 Having just said that, I take it with a grain of salt. Its just an idea. A perspective on things. Its not meant to be literal.","They're just as many hypocritical atheist with a realist view of reality, as spiritual people with a nihilist view."

 I knew a lad like this. His Dad has one of the new [ Mercedez SLS ] and he drove it to school (Here in the UK, you drive at 18) and you finish school (by law now) at 18. This kid though was a dick. I mean, he failed at school, got into pointless fights, acted like a Jersey Shore Guido and pretty sure he thought he was one. 
 Anyway, he came to school showing off this car, acting like it was his own. Everyone knew his Dad and everyone knew it was really his. We know this because he used to drive a [piece o' shit Honda]( to school and back. 
 Anyway, end of school year and there's that 1 person who is throwing the huge party that everyone goes to... inlcuding this douche. 
 He turns up in Daddy's car playijng the big man. Everyone drinking having a good time, even he managed to get ""lucky"" with that 1 easy skanky girls who'll do anything if you have the rep. 
 Rumour has it, they were fucking in the back of this spacious Merc and she threw up all over the leather interior. He decided to drive home and also got pulled over by the police. Lost his license, Daddy's car driving privaledges and i'm pretty sure he had crashed it. That's how the police got involved, either that or he was pulled over the DUI.

funny,cd99d7s,"The only information I have to compare is this: I have heard many instances where... 
 I hear arguments like this plenty. Basically anecdotes as to why it's bad somewhere else. Of course there are going to be people that have had bad experiences in any country regardless of the system used, so you'll always find negatives. 
 BUT...! 
 Ask anyone that HAS actually experienced both systems which they prefer. I know quite a few other expats, from countries with some form of public healthcare and I don't think I've ever heard a single one of them tell me they prefer the US system. They are typically overwhelmingly in favor of the system where they came from (admittedly that is mainly AU and Canada) vs the US. These are all generally well paid people, so are able to afford what passes as 'good' health insurance in the US. 
 All I'd ask of someone like you is to consider that maybe there's a reason why they feel this way. Sure it's 'opinion', but it's based on actually experiencing the alternative, not just some anecdotes they've heard. 
 > Head on over to a V.A. hospital and see how government funded health works in the U.S. 
 The entire health system in the US is broken, the awfulness that is the VA is just one symptom. 
 >The other aspect is that people don't want to pay a health care tax, while lazy turds who play xbox360 all day don't pay anything yet are entitled to the same care. 
 The thing is, lazy turds are already getting healthcare on tax payers dime. Medicaid etc already exists. Welfare in this country is out of control, with something like 1 in 7 families on 'food stamps'. There are bigger fundamental issues here. 
 Another thing is that a public health system can focus on preventative care, which minimizes costs in the long run for society as a whole. 
 Regarding taxes specifically - not to go off on too much of a tangent, but my total tax burden is similar in the US to what it was in Australia. I'm in the top tax bracket by a mile, only a tiny percentage of people would pay a higher effective tax rate than I do. I HATE taxes. So despite me being subjected to similar taxes in both countries, I'd have access to public healthcare in AU, while the US chooses to spend it's tax money elsewhere. 
 Another thing you may not realize - in Australia for example you can get private health insurance. That's where your perks come from, the skipping waiting lists, all that. You can still get a higher level of care if you want it. 
 Anyway -",If you are open minded about 'healthcare reform' ask some expats from countries that have good public health systems whether they'd prefer the US system and why.

I mean are you talking about the hundreds of amino acids in general, the proteinogenic amino acids, or just the two amino acids L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine?  And too high a concentration of the many of the proteinogenic amino acids is known to have side effects. Just because you ""eat a ton"" of amino acids in general does not mean higher concentrations of specific amino acids are ok. 
 Regardless, it is obvious that you didn't read the article in the 10 minutes it took you to reply. Let me quote from the discussion:
>In summary, our results suggest that NAS consumption in both mice and humans enhances the risk of glucose intolerance and that these adverse metabolic effects are mediated by modulation of the composition and function of the microbiota. Notably, several of the bacterial taxa that changed following NAS consumption were previously associated with type 2 diabetes in humans including over-representation of Bacteroides and under-representation of Clostridiales.

 This is not true for all animals, and certainly not for social animals. Ants for example routinely sacrifice themselves for the good of the colony. Humans are social animals.

Now consider what happens to dogs which are deprived of social contact. Lack of social contact causes severe psychological damage. Dogs need packs, humans need tribes. Compassion is a byproduct of human psychosocial evolution, because without it we would not have been able to form tribes and thus improve the overall reproductive fitness of the population.","humans, like other social animals, do what is best for the collective (overall) because it makes more babies that grow up to have even more babies."

So when person two rests on person three's legs there is now the force of person two AND person one resting on them. Then person four has to contend with the weight of all three people on them. Now that might all be fine if person four is really strong, but you have to remember that they are in an infinite loop, a mobius strip of sorts, so person one now has everyone's weight including their own and as you can clearly see this will add up infinitely until all of the participants are dead.","Has anyone ever tried this?"" a better question would be, ""Has anyone ever survived this?"""

 First of all, 11 year olds aren't always what we think.  In some ways you could say that 11 is the new 13.  Or 14.  Or 15.  Where I live, actions like this are very present in 11 year olds.  I'm not saying that's good, but it is happening.  We can point fingers at many different things, but the fact is that the world as many of us know it, has changed drastically, and my not be the world we actually think we know. 
 Which brings me to all the responses that the parents should limit her internet use, etc.  Ok that sounds really good on paper, but beyond that, it gets much more unrealsitic.  Internet is the new TV.  Most families have at least one internet ready computer, and often more than one.  Looking past that, the internet is everywhere else as well.  It's in her school, it's at her friends house, it on her and/or her friends cell phones, at the library, coffee shops, at internet cafes, etc. 
 I personally think it is funny.  I think it is a good time for all to stop, but I still think it is hilarious.  The girl likely knew saying and doing the things she said/did would draw some attention, but when it got too hot for her, she freaked out.  To me, she learned a great lesson.  Even more than one.  It hasn't gone farther than that  yet , and I hope it doesn't.  This is something that seems like a huge deal now, but in all likelihood, will be completely forgotten in the near future.  With nothing to take from it but a lesson.  Her life is not going to be ruined over it.

funny,c9mkc7m,"This is so sad! Maybe my vet office is just super awesome but i think finding the right vet is a key in making sure your dogs aren't terrified. 
 I have 2 dogs, a lab mix and a chihuahua mix. When we first got the lab as a puppy, we brought him to the vet that the humane society recommended and he wasn't ever happy about going. 
 That, on top of a recurring problem the vet always had the same ""solution"" to, made us decide to change. 
 We brought him to the new vet and they whole staff is just so nice and personable. 
 They have 3 vets but I usually see just one and the others as back-up. I feel like my vet genuinely loves my dogs and the vets that don't see them regularly seem to really care about them, and I think my dogs can tell this and know they are safe there. They are not just another chart/patient, they are pets/friends/family. 
 When I bring my dogs in, the receptionists greet them, talks to them, has them weighed and then gets us in a room where a nice vet tech talks to us, gives them scratches, talks more, and takes their temp and gives them a treat. Then after a bit, the vet comes in and talks to to us, plays with them a bit of it's just a routine check up, gives them sooo many treats. If they need shots, the vet techs administer them quickly and talk and treat as they do it and if there's an exam, the vet has techs come in and talk and pet/hold/treat while he does it. 
 Even my small dog, who is afraid of nearly everything (from brooms and lampshades to falling leaves and bicycles) and is VERY untrusting of people in general, loves the vet. 
 They don't do anything super special like baking cookies but my dogs are always happy to go to the vet. Sometimes when I'm walking them, they try and turn towards the vet clinic (it's super close). When I'm there, I never feel rushed. My vet always takes the time to fully explain things, even if he has to draw pictures and use diagrams. He understands we are on a budget and will sometimes ""forget"" to add stuff to the bill, like when our lab tore his cruciate ligament and he had a $2000 dollar surgery at the same time our small dog was getting spayed. He cut off $100 for the anaesthesia and $100 for the overnight stay and the 3 follow ups. He also gave us the small one's pain meds for free and included a ton extra for Hershey because he knew they'd need it. Oh, and he cleaned their teeth for almost half off, since they were already under anaesthetic and it was dental month (normally 20% off).

 This past Sunday, as usual, I stayed up redditing until 5 am and was sleeping well into the afternoon (2 pm) when I was suddenly woken up by the doorbell. Now, I am on a temporary work assignment in Budapest and I live in a business flat, and NO ONE ever rings my doorbell. (Other than the pizza guy.) 
 So, I get up, all drowsy and confused, go to the door without realizing that I have no pants on (I'm a girl). I open the door, and I see - the hottest guy I've seen in a long time. Young, tall, fit, with a pair of sparkling blue eyes. He opens his mouth and speaks with the sexiest British accent imaginable: 
 ""Hi! I just moved in next door, I wanted to introduce myself.""
""... Er... Hi... Sorry...."" I am still largely asleep and confused in the face of so much unexpected handsomeness. I am deeply convinced that I'm dreaming, so I don't even think about my pantlessness.
""I'm sorry, I'll come back later. I guess you were sleeping."" 
 I make a few more attempts to say something meaningful, and he leaves, but only after forever imprinting his gorgeous smile in my mind. I crawl back into bed and continue sleeping. 
 Half an hour later, I wake up with a start. It finally hit me. THIS HAPPENED. It wasn't some softcore porn dream. I jump up, thanking heaven for the fact that I had nice-looking lacy underwear on and not my pair of Spongebob hotpants. It takes me forty minutes to clean my apartment, take a shower, put on a crisp, casually awesome-looking dress shirt and pants, and make a pot of coffee. I feel so elated that my courage doesn't fail me... I go next door, ring the doorbell, and, as my beautiful neighbor opens the door, I say in my coolest voice, 
 ""Oh hi. I just made a fresh pot of coffee. Want a cup?"" 
 We ended up talking for three hours - two young, attractive, single people stranded in Budapest on business. And during the entire conversation I kept asking myself, 'is this REALLY happening?!' In the end, he asked me out for drinks this coming weekend.

The only jobs I found were through Craig's List, every other avenue I used to apply to postings was like sending a resume (or hour-long forms) into a black hole.  After nearly three years of being unemployed more often than working, I decided I would waste no more time searching for work online. 
 I had no real experience from college, and my jobs after consisted of door-to-door and telephone sales, interviewing businesses for an online directory, and a tiny bit of freelance journalism for an online publication (latter two jobs were for Patch.com).  I was also under the constraint of having no license for over 18 months because of weed possession, so I had a lot going against me when getting a job is hard enough without those 'handicaps.' 
 I decided to hit the streets, go to 20 or 30 businesses in bicycling distance and see where that would take me.  I knocked on about 20 doors, from insurance branches to deli's & thrift stores to the town's chamber of commerce.  I also went to the office of our local state representative, and a few businesses where I wasn't sure what they did.  That day, I would meet two future employers.  I got a job working at a thrift store, started out part time but I got 35 hours/week after working there for two weeks.  Another business I went to that day was a market research firm.  I walked in, unaware of what the business was, showed them a resume and sat down with the owners discussing if there was any way I could volunteer my time, helping out with whatever projects or tasks I could.  I ended up using my writing experience to write press releases and articles and edit lengthy white papers.  For seven months, I would come into the market research place in the mornings for an hour or two a few times a week, and then work at the thrift store from 12pm - 7pm M-F.  Through demonstrating my skills and value and persuading them that more work needed to be done to launch their new study, I was able to convince them that the ""more work"" couldn't be done unless I was working full time.  I was brought on as the director of communications at the end of June and was able to quit the thrift store.

It stung at first, but a couple weeks and obvious results on the scale bolstered my confidence, and I made it a point to, when we went out for breakfast, put on a grand show of bacon and full egg omelettes with spinach and peppers, while they stared at egg whites, yoghurt, and fruit. Each week I showed clear results, and over the course of a summer I lost more weight then them combined, and I felt great doing it. I still feel great. 
 Should I have been the showman? Probably not, but it was such a good feeling watching their disdain turn into disbelief. One big thing to note is that I was very aware of my caloric intake, and made sure not to put down the gravy pipe more than what it took to run the engine, but eating keto fills you up quick, and it wasn't nearly the deal to manage intake as it was for my fellow want-to-be-fitters.","Bacon and Eggs with spinach and peppers rocks as a breakfast, and you can get it dang near anywhere.

Sure enough everyone told me the bike had followed me like a trusty dog. It got to the point where I was looking in every ditch, hole nook and cranny to see if the bike had been left somewhere.

 Those people are wrong. 
 They are both fantastic in their own right, but are not comparable at all. 
 Personally, I find the most impressive part to be that they are sequels that went in completely different directions in genre, style, and tone, and still managed to be good films.  No other series has ever done that. 
 I think most people tend to think of the second as better for two reasons.  Action movies in general are more popular than horror, which means Aliens got more exposure than the first one.  And secondly, the rest of the series (and all the weird expanded universe bullshit) went the same action-packed route as Aliens, so people going back to the franchise's origins are expecting an action film and are disappointed in Alien's lack of guns and killing.

funny,c6plhnq,"Actually incredibly logical! 
 For one thing, a horse (if it is walking in the city to begin with) is likely on the street. Whether it's a stand-alone horse-with-rider, or a horse or pair of horses hitched to a buggy or sleigh or cart of some sort, it'll likely be in the street - you rarely see them on sidewalks or paths intended for pedestrian traffic. Dogs, on the other hand, are likely to be walking, leashed or not, close by to their humans - aka on the sidewalks/paths intended for pedestrian traffic. If they aren't directly on the walkway, they'll be on the grass to either side of it, most likely. Because of this, horse droppings will be 'out of the way' for the most part - cars won't even hit them because they're likely to be in the middle of the laneway versus nearer to the sides, where tires would be. 
 Secondly, an owner walking a dog is doing just that - walking a dog! If doggy's gotta go, both parties are gonna have to stop and wait. It follows that, while they're stopped, it won't take that much more time to pull a baggy out of their pocket (or one of those neat little on-the-go doggy bag dispensers they have at the dollar store), lean over, and do a quick poop scoop. Horses, on the other hand, are either being ridden, or are pulling something. They don't stop to poop - they just lift their tail and carry on business as usual! This means that the rider would have to be constantly watching, then stop, dismount, sweep up a substantial amount of waste, and dispose of it properly before mounting again - oh, and unless it's a very well trained horse and the area was one with an incredibly low amount of potential spooking-sources... The horse would also have to be tied up somewhere while the disposal was taking place. In the case of a carriage of some sort, the driver would likely see the poop happening already, but would still have to stop the cart, get down out of it, sweep up the waste, properly dispose, etc etc. Again, the cart would have to be somehow locked/tied, as well, to avoid being horse-jacked (it happens!) while the driver was occupied.","leaving horse poop is kind of inevitable, leaving dog poop is gross and lazy"

funny,c126hdb,"First of all, I live in spain, I think our law is somewhat different about this, let me explain:
Here, most of what people would call ""pirating"" is legal in music and movies (no videogames/programs), this is because in the past, when there was no internet, people would copy cassettes and lend them to friends etc, P2P is considered pretty much the same thing, it's people sharing files, there are no sales, and no one gets money from that. 
 Enter SGAE, which would be pretty much like your RIAA, they claim that pirating things is killing music, they claim it's killing our culture, they claim that any of these years, there will be no music in spain. They have been claiming that for more than 20 years now. 
 You see, the music business is a funny thing, to make a living out of it you probably have to be widely known, and no one could do that years ago, you needed to go to a record company, where they would advertise you, and record CDs so people could hear your music, then you would make concerts and make a living out of it, the problem is, as this WAS the only way things were possible before, the contracts are pretty abusing, but it's your only way to go, so you do it anyway. 
 This means: recording a CD, marketing it, spreading the CDs around the world, selling them to stores, and then stores sell them. that's a lot of people getting paid to do that 
 The problem now is the very existence of internet, the current music market is beyond stupid, as record companies need to make money, they insist in that way of doing things, instead of a more simple, easy one: 
 Record a CD, put it on your web, sell it online, all the money goes to the people who actually made music.
It is incredibly cheaper, an artist would easily make 2x or 3x the money from CDs than they make now, and that would be selling the same music at 25% the price that it is sold now. 
 We could do things better, more easily, and cheaper, but, you see, that wouldn't be nice for them, so let's do it the old way, fuck consumers, get cash","current music market system is stupid, piracy goes the logic way, fuck them if they don't get it"

funny,c2i6bn5,"The stack is there to restore the program to its previous state (so when you call any function it's stashing the current value of all the current function's variables on the stack). Let's take 2 simple examples of programs (they're both infinitely recursive because that was faster to type but that's irrelevant to the general principle) 
 function f(x):
    i = x * random();

    return f(i);
 
 This is tail recursive (albeit infinitely recursive) so the compiler can rewrite it to:
    function f(x):
        ret = x; 
     &lt;start&gt;

    ret = ret * random();
    goto &lt;start&gt;

    return ret
 
 So here there's a single variable allocated, ret. We never need to restore any value from a previous function call.
Whereas the following program performs some function after its recursion so it is not tail recursive. This state must be restored when the inner function call returns: 
 function f(x):
    i = x * random();
    j = f(i);

    print(i)
    return j;
 
 Here the program prints the innermost value of i first and the outermost value last - it's not possible to reorder the expression in any way to avoid the accumulation of an extra ""i"" every time we call the function.","By not adding a stack frame for each method call you'd be overwriting the state of the previous call, which is essential to the correct operation of the program (assuming you don't have a tail recursive function).

 (1) Classifying Turkey as 'ethnically European' is a massive stretch... Do you think there is no racial difference at all between a German and a Turk? You've got to be fucking kidding me. 
 (2) There's a similar assumption that 'European' is even a race without internal diversity. Suppose you have two groups of ten people. Group A has a Swede, a Norman Englishman, a Spaniard, an Italian, a Maltese, a Roma, a Magyar, a German, a Greek and a Finn. Group B has 6 Italian-Americans and 4 African-Americans, all of whom were born and grew up in the United States. Which group is more diverse? 
 (3)  How the fuck is even 2% of the population ""very few people""?! 
 What is less obvious is that at least some of those numbers are wrong in addition to the miscategorisation of Turkey. Here's some raw data for you from a report published six weeks ago by the UK Office of National Statistics on the ethnic composition of the population of England and Wales: 
 [Current Estimates - Population Estimates by Ethnic Group Mid-2009 (experimental)]( 
 All Groups 54,809.1
White: British 45,682.1
White: Irish 574.2
White: Other White 1,932.6
Mixed: White and Black Caribbean 310.6
Mixed: White and Black African 131.8
Mixed: White and Asian 301.6
Mixed: Other Mixed 242.6
Indian 1,434.2
Pakistani 1,007.4
Bangladeshi 392.2
Other (South) Asian 385.7
Black Caribbean 615.2
Black African 798.8
Other Black 126.1
Chinese 451.5
Other 422.6 
 That right there is 12.08% non-white. Scotland is about 2% non-white and Northern Ireland is about 0.85% white, which brings the UK average down to 10.92% non-white. This is probably still a conservative estimate, due to the following: 
 
 The UK (primarily England and Wales) hosts about 60,000 Brazilians, 100,000 white Afrikaners, maybe 40,000 Israelis, etc etc, many of whom would be listed as 'Other White'. The 12.08% figure may very well actually be >12.4% when defined as non-European rather than non-white. 
 
 These figures are only for the resident population, so you've got to account for the persistent temporary non-white population. The ONS (Travel Trends 2009) says that the UK gets 29.89 million visitors a year, of which 4.42 million reside in countries that are not Europe or North America. That's an extra 12,000 people per night of average stay duration. 
 
 Estimates for the number of illegal immigrants in the UK are around 400,000 to 600,000.

 Don't know what they're talking about to say kids don't need leashes? Kids didn't need them before they were invented. How can you argue they could need them now that they have been invented? 
 Guess what? If your parents let you get lost to teach you a lesson every time you ran away, and you never learned your lesson, then  they could have tried another approach . That's literally what parenting is: trial and error. Your parents obviously didn't put in enough dynamic trials and approaches if you  never  learned your lesson. A kid can always learn what behaviors are and are not acceptable, and resorting to force to teach this is pretty lousy. Parents should take strict pride in always reasoning with their kids until progress is made. 
 Plus you couldn't argue that there was no approach your parents could possibly have tried that would have worked for you to stop. The whole ""some kids just never learn"" argument I find is supported the most by parents who are authoritarian because it's easy. Kids can learn, and learning is primarily what they do until their brain develops enough through adolescence that they become well-developed and independent.","The easy way isn't the right way. You can use a leash if you want, and they can absolutely help. But you can't even start to argue that if you resort to using one then you're taking the best parenting approach for your kid. And if you're a parent and aren't actively pursuing the best approach to raising your kid with the best quality, then that's pretty lousy."

funny,c0jaqex,"I lived in on-campus apartments for 2 years in college. They had a large kitchen/dining aria, a hall closet with no door, 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. 
 Anyway, one weekend, me, my three roommates and the rest of the people in the other 3 apartments on the floor decided to have a floor party. We invited over damn near everyone we knew. There were easily 200+ people on our floor, music blasting and booze flowing in every apartment. 
 So of course the campus cops showed up. 
 They started on our side of the floor, and busted the girls next door. The poor girls got in huge trouble for hosting an unregistered party, breaking noise regulations and serving alcohol to minors. 
 Due to the shape of the building (built like a large L) the people in the other 2 apartments were able to sneak out the fire door (The alarm was easily disconnected) without being seen. But the ones in our apartment were trapped and couldn't get out without being spotted. 
 So, in shear panic mode we started shoving drunk people anywhere they could hide. In the bedrooms and bathroom and the hall closet, thumbtacked a bedsheet over the doorway to the closet. We were so desperate to hide the people that we forgot about the keg, which was sitting right by the door, until the cops knocked. So we threw a blanket over it, like that somehow disguised what it was. 
 Anyway, the cops opened the door and were greeted with the following scene: 
 The four of us sitting around the kitchen table with our textbooks open at 1am on a friday night. 
 About 60 drunk people were hidden in the apartment. Out of sight but you could still hear them giggling and moving around. 
 Red plastic cups and beer bottles were scattered EVERYWHERE. 
 And the trashcan full of ice that the keg was sitting in had started to leak, forming a large puddle. 
 We looked at each other and I somehow managed to say with a straight face ""Is there a problem officers?"" 
 They looked around the apartment, looked back at us and asked if we knew anything about the party they had just broken up. 
 I responded ""Oh, so was that what all that noise was? We were trying to study."" 
 The cops looked at each other this time, then started laughing. 
 ""You got guts kid. Just try to keep it down from now on."" 
 And then they left. We didn't get in any trouble at all.","version: We were hosting a party that was about to get busted. We attempted, very poorly, to hide all the people and evidence. We did such a bad job hiding everything that it made the cops laugh and they let us off."

funny,cas0lp9,"If you're trying to make the argument against Romo you did a shitty job of doing it. Your stats actually helped to show Jps8516's point. He might've been wrong about being first, but Romo is still pretty close. All those stats paint a pretty good picture for a QB who passes a lot, and is mostly successful when passing. He threw for almost 5,000yds last season. Only Brees and Stafford had more. If you're a qb in the NFL throwing for 4,967yds then you're throwing the ball an insane amount. Not every QB is going to be Brady or Rodgers. Farve passed the ball a bunch too. He also is the all time leader in interceptions 
 I would say 
 3rd out of 40 
 2nd of 40 
 5th of 40 
 3rd of 40 
 9th of 40 
 6th of 40 
 for the major statistics 
 are pretty decent stats for a quarterback 
 (40 instead of 32 because there are 40 qbs that threw enough last year to meet the statistical min to be counted.) 
 He is above average in almost all important categories. He's in the top 1/4 of the league in most of them. How does that paint a picture of a bad qb? It doesn't 
 It's unfair to compare Romo to Brady or Rodgers when they run completely different styles of offenses, and have completely different personnel on their teams. Look at the other guy who is tied with Romo for most interceptions. Drew Brees. Same guy who is ahead or right near Romo in almost all those categories you mentioned (his rankings are 1, 3rd, 10th, 1st, 6th, 1st, and 1st for those stats you listed for Romo respective top to bottom). He runs an offense that relies almost solely on passing too. He threw a ton of interceptions too. Brees is still an elite qb. The team he had around him was very weak. There is only so much one player can do when your defenses are terrible. You are going to throw a bunch of interceptions trying to bring your team back. 32nd ranked defense for the Saints, below average 19th for dallas 
 Those int stats can be misleading. It is known that when a qb is trying to bring his team back late in games he throws many more interceptions. He has to force the throws, or else they lose. They don't have the luxury of having many more drives to try and comeback. That means more dangerous throws, and a higher likelihood of getting picked off. If you have a team like the Pats where they have a comfortable lead in most late game situations, of course the qb is going to throw less interceptions. Brady didn't have to make plays and force throws to get his team back in it. Dallas trailed at some point in the fourth in 13 out of 16 games last season. That is a whole bunch of late game passing. 
 You comment about Romo's interception rate being among the worst in the league is flat wrong. I couldn't find the int rate stat so I figured it up myself. [You can do it too if you don't believe me]( 
 Romo's int rate is an interception every 34.1 pass attempts 
 Out of the qbs that threw enough to be counted 
 thats better than 
 Batch 17 
 Skelton 22.3 
 Cassel 23 
 Lindley 24 
 Quinn 24.6 
 Sanchez 25.1 
 Henne 28 
 Locker 28.5 
 Weeden 30.4 
 Cutler 31 
 Fitzpatrick 31.5 
 Freeman 32.8 
 Dalton 33 
 It's not the greatest, but it is most definitely not ""one of the worst in the league"". If you're going to try and show the other guy's stats wrong how about you make sure your own stats are up to par. At least he was in the ballpark only 1 or 2 away from his guesses. You were off by ~13. 
 Middle of the pack does not equal one of the worst in the league. He had a better rate than 32.5% of the counted qbs. Being better than ~1/3rd of them is not ""one of the worst in the league"". It's not one of the best either, it is below average, but it's unfair to put him in there with the truly awful quarterbacks. 
 Also Stafford was only better than Romo in interceptions by a little bit. Stafford had 17 Romo had 19. 1.18 per game to 1.06 per game. Romo didn't have one of the greatest receivers to ever play the game on his side last season. Stafford did. IMO if you were to put Stafford on a team like Dallas, he would probably end up with more interceptions than Romo had. It's all about the personnel you have, and Romo really doesn't have near the personnel Stafford had","Romo is doing his job perfectly fine. He really doesn't deserve most of the criticism. Blame the management of the Cowboys for being unable to give him the tools to have success at a high level in the league. 
 One player's stats don't give you the actual picture of what happened throughout the season. There are many variables to take into account when evaluating players. Those variables can have a huge impact on the numbers each player puts up.

funny,c78l6ol,"BMW North America (manufacturer) is a separate entity than the individual dealership. The warranties on all BMW vehicles, not just the M-Series would've covered this if under the original warranty period/mileage allotment. 
 Additionally, BMW NA contact customers who are nearing the expiration of their warranty to offer an extended warranty. It is expensive, but well worth it in my opinion because the service and maintenance on BMWs is expensive. When my brother was called about his warranty a month ago, I told him to extend it - an oil change service in California can cost $2,500.00 retail. Your friend should have bought the extended warranty. 
 Did he buy new or CPO? Did the Dealer offer a supplemental warranty that decided not to cover this (if that was the case, that's the dealer's product)? What was the mileage when he took it in for service? At 20K, it would've only had service once based on mileage, BUT a vehicle that isn't driven that much would need a low mileage maintenance schedule. 
 I can't help but feel like this is inflammatory based on the information provided.

 EDIT  Sorry, I've been at school all day. Here's how it can cost $2.5K retail in CA: dealers set their own prices. This is also at one of the most expensive dealers in CA. The oil systems on the vehicles are closed systems. This also covers the full scheduled maintenance, not just the oil. We're talking brakes, rotors, wipers, oil, fluids, lube, and all the typical crap that needs done. 
 Even if you do have a mechanic that specializes in BMWs, they cannot reset the computers in the vehicle and it will be off on the maintenance. Not really a big deal if you own the car, and don't mind the computer constantly reminding you to perform scheduled maintenance. If the vehicle is still under warranty, a non-BMW certified mechanic will void the warranty. Additionally, if driving a leased vehicle, it will violate the terms of the contract and all sorts of charges apply.

funny,c6nf6sd,"To me the freakiest child experiment is the Stanford Marshmallow Test, because apparently it is a reasonable predictor of success later in life. Delayed gratification: if you've got it for a yummy marshmallow, you'll likely have it for education, workplace decisions, marital relationships, etc. 
 EDIT: thanks to apostrotastrophe for linking to a video that shows the experiment (see below). 
 An additional note. When Mischel originally did this experiment, he was really just trying to learn more about impulse control and delayed gratification. He didn't have any clue that it would be a predictor of anything later in life. What happened was a very, very long time later (20 years? I'm not sure), he did some followup with the kids (now adults). He was interviewing them about educational achievement, career choices, marital history, and was gobsmacked to see that there seemed to be a pretty strong correlation between the kids that were able to resist eating the marshmallows and later success in life. 
 The","version of the theory he came up with to explain it was that if you have a hard time delaying gratification, you're less likely to put in long years with higher education, less likely to pay dues on a job for career advancement, and more likely to either do things to cause a marriage to fail, or possibly not put in the work to save a troubled marriage. 
 I'm not sure how this hypothesis has stood the test of time, but it's just freaky to think that a kid's being able or not able to resist eating a marshmallow potentially signals the path their adult life will take."

 I was working in a call centre at the time. I'm sure most of you all know by now, but call centres are one of the shittiest places to work. Not only do you get crap from the customers, but you get crap from your managers too. Everything is about call times, number of calls taken, etc etc. They don't give a shit about you. 
 Anyway, that's my semi-justification for doing what I did. 
 I had worked there for a while, and a couple times I got put on special projects, like responding to email requests rather than phone calls, and putting together reports on certain things. We all got paid based on being signed in to our phone on our desk. It was used like a time card, so if we don't sign in, we don't get paid. We'd get in shit if we signed in and sat in ""idle"" mode, so we always had to switch to ""ready"" (meaning we're ready to take calls). But if you were on a special project, they gave you a code to sign in to a separate status that would show you're working, but not taking calls from the queue. 
 So after doing this a few times, and no one bothering me with anything (seriously,  every  shift you worked you got hassled by your manager about something), I put my plan into action.

 Modify-headers is a free add-on for Firefox that can modify the headers sent by your browsers to the servers of the websites your viewing. One of these headers is ""X-Forwarded-For"". This is used when people are behind proxies to transmit their original IP. However we can absue this by making it seem as if our regular, non-US ip was the proxy and put in whatever we want using modify headers. 
 So if you download and install modify headers, all you have to do is add one line on the screen with the following information: 
 Action     Name                Value       Comment
==================================================================
Add        X-Forwarded-For     12.13.14.15
 
 So, in other words you're  adding  a header. What kind? An  ""X-Forwarded-For""  header with the Value, i.e. the IP  12.13.14.15  (an american IP) 
 Then you have to click on the red dot to turn it green so it is turned on. (This way you can also turn it off if you want to visit a non-US site where you need your original IP). 
 Under Options you should tick ""Always On:..."" so modify-headers is always on. As said before you can still turn off the function.

funny,c4hd5js,"In college I was taking a genetics course (which also happened to be my major) and my school had just begun to implement ""group learning"" where you sit in groups of 7-9 and work on weekly questions/quizzes together and there are two long term projects that you work on together throughout the semester. 
 WELL! One girl in my group was your typical I-know-everything-so-I-am-going-to-correct-you-whenever-you-say-something kind of girl. She was continuously trying to correct us and put our ideas down as well as never actually doing any of her own work. She would send out data but would never make sense of it herself or compile anything on her own. Now, like I said, I'm a genetics major...I got this shit...this is what my degree will be in, so I'm not having any of that business. Anyway, I digress. So, each week we had a set of questions that we are supposed to answer ""as a group"" which really meant, you did it on your own and then e-mailed it to the group if someone had something to add or correct. Often these questions were directly related to compiling information about our long-term projects. 
 Anyway, it was time for her to do the group question and on the day we were correcting it in class, she had nothing done. We had all sent her some links and information when we could over the week for her to compile into a written format that could be later put into the final project, so we were pissed she had nothing done. 
 So there I am, sitting next to her, literally telling her word for word what to type so we would get an A on this weekly assignment, I decided to ask her why she hadn't done any of this over the last week. She turned to me, and I swear to FSM she said, ""Well, I can't be doing everything, I want to make sure you know what this project is about."" I looked her in the eye and I railed into her.

Two times I selected ""slow connectivity"" for Verizon's automated service to connect me to a line that apparently didn't exist (it connected and then stated ""I'm sorry, this department does not exist"").

funny,cbac9qm,"Not to restart the discussion from up in the ""hardcore"" thread, but basically hardcore and scene music is punks imitating the popular or groundbreaking metal of 10-15 years ago. 
 
 80's first wave of hardcore took heavy riffs from 70s rock and played them at breakneck speeds with barking vocals. Hardcore is formed. 
 
 In the 90s you had post-hardcore which was really like the third wave of hardcore. It also mixed in elements of grunge rock. Quicksand, Glassjaw, and Helmet are examples of post-hardcore. 
 
 Metallic hardcore came along in the mid and late 90s. These guys took elements from Pantera and early death metal and put a punk spin on it. You also had where thrash metal and metallic hardcore brought the metal and hardcore scenes together. It became acceptable for hardcore kids and metalheads to mingle. Hatebreed and Converge fall into here. 
 In the early 2000s you had metalcore which took Iron Maiden, thrash metal, and melodic death metal and mixed it with 90s hardcore. This ended up being commercially lucrative for some bands. Bands like Atreyu, Bullet For My Valentine, Killswitch Engage, and early Avenged Sevenfold fall into this. 
 Deathcore came along in the mid 2000s and is basically metalcore but tuned down to A. They took mid 90s brutal death metal riffs in the style of Nile, Dying Fetus, or Cannibal Corpse. Band like Emmure, Oceano, and Suicide Silence go here. 
 Nu nu metal came a long for a little while around 2010-2011 but faded out quickly. Basically some deathcore bands that grew up on Korn and Limp Bizkit in the early 2000s needed to evolve when the deathcore scene became crowded. The vocalist of Suicide Silence said that their last album was ""nu nu metal."" 
 What next? Deathcore's Bring Me The Horizon tried to make a post-metal album that got cancelled exactly ten years after ISIS's Oceanic.

 I don't believe that you are aware of the physics of the matter, especially things having to do with [force.]( 
 The acceleration is likely not as much as you think. Regardless, the non-aerodynamic nature of a squirrel will result in a great deal of drag and a slower velocity upon landing. 
 The G forces experienced by the squirrel upon take-off are likely very small, considering the weight of the squirrel. Most squirrels are 1-1.5 pounds so that's between ~450-675 grams. You'll need to calculate the amount of [g-force]( that the squirrel experiences at takeoff, given the rate of acceleration, and then compare that number to the amount of g-force necessary to kill/injure a squirrel. I'm not sure if those numbers exist, but fatal g-force is likely to be much higher for a squirrel than a human due to it's difference in weight and size. To calculate, you need to know the rate of acceleration, the time duration of the acceleration, angle, and maximum velocity. To simplify, let's calculate the g-force for the squirrel travelling horizontally. 
 We'd have to make some assumptions, so let's be aggressive and say this squirrel reaches a velocity of 10 m/s at it's peak, and the acceleration time is .5 seconds. 
 If Acceleration = Change in Velocity / Change in time then we might say this: 
 A=10/.5= 20m/s^2 The force of acceleration then is 20 meter per second squared. If the force of gravity is 9.8m/s^2, then 20/9.8=a little over 2 g's.

 Abstract: Evidence regarding the impact of nurse practitioners (NPs) compared to physicians (MDs) on health care quality, safety, and effectiveness was systematically reviewed. Data from 37 of 27,993 articles published from 1990-2009 were summarized into 11 aggregated outcomes. Outcomes for NPs compared to MDs (or teams without NPs) are comparable or better for all 11 outcomes reviewed. A high level of evidence indicated better serum lipid levels in patients cared for by NPs in primary care settings. A high level of evidence also indicated that patient outcomes on satisfaction with care, health status, functional status, number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, blood glucose, blood pressure, and mortality are similar for NPs and MDs.

 Executive Summary: Advanced practice registered nurses have assumed an increasing role as providers in the health care system, particularly for underserved populations. The aim of this systematic review was to answer the following question: Compared to other providers (physicians or teams without APRNs) are APRN patient outcomes
of care similar? This systematic review of published literature between 1990 and 2008 on care provided by APRNs indicates patient outcomes of care provided by nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives in collaboration with physicians are similar to and in some ways better than care provided by physicians alone for the populations and in the settings included. Use of clinical nurse specialists in acute care settings can reduce length of stay and cost of care for hospitalized patients. These results extend what is known about APRN outcomes from previous reviews by assessing all types of APRNs over a span of 18 years, using a systematic process with intentionally broad inclusion of outcomes, patient populations, and settings. The results indicate APRNs provide effective and high-quality patient care, have an important role in improving the quality of patient care in the United States, and could help to address concerns about whether care provided by APRNs can safely augment the physician supply to support reform efforts aimed at expanding access to care.

 Cochrane Review Conclusion: The findings suggest that appropriately trained nurses can produce as high quality care as primary care doctors and achieve as good health outcomes for patients. However, this conclusion should be viewed with caution given that only one study was powered to assess equivalence of care, many studies had methodological limitations, and patient follow-up was generally 12 months or less. 
 While doctor-nurse substitution has the potential to reduce doctors' workload and direct healthcare costs, achieving such reductions depends on the particular context of care. Doctors' workload may remain unchanged either because nurses are deployed to meet previously unmet patient need or because nurses generate demand for care where previously there was none. Savings in cost depend on the magnitude of the salary differential between doctors and nurses, and may be offset by the lower productivity of nurses compared to doctors.

 Abstract: Context Studies have suggested that the quality of primary care delivered by nurse practitioners is equal to that of physicians. However, these studies did not measure nurse practitioner practices that had the same degree of independence as the comparison physician practices, nor did previous studies provide direct comparison of outcomes for patients with nurse practitioner or physician providers. 
 Objective To compare outcomes for patients randomly assigned to nurse practitioners or physicians for primary care follow-up and ongoing care after an emergency department or urgent care visit.

 Abstract: This study reports results of the 2-year follow-up phase of a randomized study comparing outcomes of patients assigned to a nurse practitioner or a physician primary care practice. In the sample of 406 adults, no differences were found between the groups in health status, disease-specific physiologic measures, satisfaction or use of specialist, emergency room or inpatient services. Physician patients averaged more primary care visits than nurse practitioner patients. The results are consistent with the 6-month findings and with a growing body of evidence that the quality of primary care delivered by nurse practitioners is equivalent to that by physicians.

 Abstract: Thirty-three advanced practice nurses (APNs) in 25 different primary care sites in one state participated in a study of the safety and effectiveness of APN prescriptive authority. Data were analyzed on 1,708 patients seen during a 2-month period. Outcomes of care were studied using three different measures as well as patient satisfaction. Evaluation of patient outcome by APN and physician indicated that in 76% of the cases, the patient's condition stabilized or improved. Patients evaluated their own outcomes positively. Participating physicians were unanimous in their evaluation of APN prescriptive authority as beneficial to their patients. 
 Outcomes associated with advanced nursing practice prescriptive authority.

 CONCLUSIONS:
The tasks and activities performed by acute care nurse practitioners and physician assistants are similar to those performed by resident physicians. However, residents treat patients who are sicker and older than those treated by acute care nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Patients' outcomes are similar for both groups of subjects.

funny,ch2gdyl,"It's like riding a bike. We all have cars, what's the point of riding a bike anymore? I haven't ridden a bike since I was a kid! Learning how to ride bikes is useless! That's from Victorian times! 
 Children all ride bikes because children can't get drivers licenses and bikes are their only practical mode of conveyance. The skill of riding a bike also sticks with you far more easily, as it's simply a matter of learning to balance your body. Most young children struggle with this becuause they've barely learned how to run without falling over at the time that they're being taught how to ride a bike. 
 I'm 32 years old. I haven't written in cursive since I was in 6th grade. Aside from my signature (and really, just the first initial of my first name; everything else is just an illegible squiggle), I couldn't remember how to write 80% of the alphabet in cursive if I had a gun to my head. I also haven't ridden a bike since I got my drivers license back in '98. I guarantee I could hop on a bike tomorrow and take off down the street without issues.","riding a bike is actually useful at a time in your life when you don't have other options for personal mobility. Writing in cursive is a pointless skill that the vast majority are never going to use again once they're out of elementary school, despite being fed lies when they're learning it about how relevant it would be in the world at large. I'd much rather children be learning proper grammar and expanding their vocabularies than learning how to write without taking their pens off the page."
funny,cjvf15i,"I worked as a janitor for a few years here in there in my early twenties, and I can say with a ton of personal experience, that the majority of women, are fucking slobs. 
 Guys will piss on the floor, the toilet seat, it even gets on the walls. Their shits are epic and will occasionally cover the underside of a toilet seat. They will even leave pubic hair in urinals. Yet women could always outperform men in the gross department, especially communal restrooms. 
 Blood is a biohazard, period (no pun intended). Even if it comes out of your vagina. Let someone know so it doesn't get tracked everywhere. 
 The toilet seat is a million times cleaner than you think, hovering sprays piss everywhere. Instead of getting it on your ass, it's splattering every place that has an angle on the bowl. If you want to know how well a restroom gets cleaned, look under the seat, it serves as a fantastic indicator of how well the cleaning staff is actually cleaning the toilets. 
 The worst continuing experience I ever had was black women of low socioeconomic status. I don't know why, but they would actively try to clog toilets with wads of toilet paper and paper towels. We would have to use trash bags as shoulder length gloves to pull out wads from toilets, when that didn't work, which was often, plumbers had to come in to clear them. 
 I never understood it, you share the restroom with every other woman you work with. Why actively make it repulsive? Don't these women say anything when they see others doing this?","Don't be a dick when you use a restroom, other people use it and there is  always  someone that has to clean it."
funny,c32k81d,"Sorry... wall of text forthcoming. 
 I wouldn't be too worried. Spelling comes in stages. Kids start by drawing scribbles which they label as words, and they start spelling their name. They may also recognize most of the letters in the alphabet and a few letter/sound associations. This is where most kids are at the end of preschool. But not all kids are there yet, and that is okay. 
 Then they start writing random letters and labeling them as words. Then they start recognizing sounds and identifying which letter each sound corresponds to. At this stage they will start writing ""sentences."" For unknown words they may use only the beginning and ending consonant sound. They will try to use vowels in their writing but may not always be accurate. They will start spelling ""sight"" words more accurately (using vowels). They may not be using spaces between words. This type of writing is usually seen at the end of kindergarten. But, once again not all kids develop at the same rate. 
 Then they start adding in the sounds of vowels and blends (br, ch, sh). Finally you will start seeing more nuanced spelling patterns (silent letters, etc.) Teachers start formal spelling instruction at this point (3rd or 4th grade) 
 What right0ast said is correct. During this time kids will be taught certain ""sight"" words (Dolch words are sight words). These are the words that they are not expected to sound out when reading; they should just recognize them by sight. Usually these are common words that they will encounter often (to, and, of, see) or words that are not phonemic or spelled the way they sound (through). It can't hurt to help her practice these. Think about how you read. More than likely you have a huge sight vocabulary and rarely have to focus in on the individual letters in each word. 
 Other helpful hints are to focus on practicing her name and the names of familiar people. Their name is usually the first word children learn how to spell. Focus on consonants and don't worry too much about vowels yet(but talk about them and the sounds they make). Ask her questions all the time such as ""Look a lion! What letter does that start with. L..ion. L. What letter is that?"" It's a great way to practice on the fly. Let her spell things phonemically (it's okay if she spells cat like kat). But it's also okay to remind her that c makes the k sound too. Point out spelling patterns such as -at (cat, rat, sat, fat). --og (frog, dog, log) -all (fall, ball, tall). The key is drawing her attention to the written word and letting her practice writing in a low stress environment. It doesn't have to be accurate yet. But she needs as much practice as she can get.",The child who wrote this book is relatively advanced when it comes to spelling. Kids learn at different rates.

funny,cgsjsdd,"Originally, the Simpsons had jokes that were more character-based. The characters were static, you knew them and their behaviour was predictable. These characters were then placed into a comedic situation, such as a runaway amusement park, and the comedy came out of these characters' reactions to the situation. 
 When the show 'declined,' Futurama was suddenly coming into the foray. Likewise, Family Guy hit the scene as well. Fans of the Simpsons were automatically Futurama fans, but, Family Guy, more than anything, was getting press and controversy and, more importantly, new viewership. It's cultural references and random humor were appealing to new, younger, audiences. 
 The writing in the Simpsons started to reflect this shift in style. Rather than always being stupid, Homer would sometimes do something genius, only to then make a comment reminding us he is stupid, but being able to use the genius bit in some later gag. Lisa would be a left-wing feminist in once scene, but then say something stereotypically girly in another with no real reason. The characters became inconsistent. They acted however the writers' needed them to so that a joke could work. It became more like a series of sketches, starring characters from the Simpsons. The jokes themselves could still be funny one-liners, but the cohesiveness that the earlier episodes had just wasn't there. 
 I mean, look at the Monorail episode. Just re-watch it sometime, and then watch the funniest new episode. Both are good, but they're completely different in writing style.  The old model died to bring in new viewers that responded to a different comedy style. 
 The old viewers moved on to shows like Futurama and King of the Hill, and they got their random situation humor from Family Guy.",Simpsons shifted from their original character-based comedy to a more 'Family Guy' style of random situation comedy.

I turn around to reply to something my friend said and when I turned back around, I see a notice stuck on the outside of my window.  No knock, nothing.  I fling the door open and pull the notice off, and look to see the truck pulling down the street.  So, like any sane person would do, I took off running down the street after it like a madman. 
 I finally caught up to the truck about a block and a half later when they stopped for another delivery, completely out of breath.  I run up to the truck, gasping for air, and demanding my package.

 Way back in high school, on the  second day  of high school, I got to school and then had to go to the bathroom. 
 I walk into the stall, drop trou, and do my thing.  When I pull up my pants, I realize that someone had pissed  all over the floor  and my shorts had just been marinating in it.  Like some hell-forged teabag with an Earl Grey of human waste. 
 I am horrified at the idea that someone else has, in fact, pissed my pants.  I try to dry them off on those god forsaken hand dryers.  It goes  alright. 
 I go to class, reeking of stale, water-deprived piss.  No one notices, or has the heart to tell me they did, at least.  I go out during a free period and play some frisbee.  Someone throws it over a wall, and I vault over it to get it back.  I try to leap back over, but tear my shorts in half.  I don't mean I ripped them a lot, I mean they were literally torn asunder. 
 I clamp my shorts together as best as I can, throw the frisbee back, get laughed at by my friends, and go to the gym to try to get some replacement shorts. 
 Then I remember it's the second day of high school.  No one has brought gym clothes yet.  Fuck. 
 I talk to a coach, who informs me that all they have left are wrestling clothes.  I grudgingly accept the spandex floss he tosses at me. 
 I spend the rest of the day, balls flopped out like two Pac-Men talking over a tennis net. 
 I then remembered I had to meet a guidance counselor that day to talk about my career plans and stayed after school to do so, my jim-jams all a-googly, precipitously dangling from my borrowed attire.

Hating a person because of the amount of pigment in their skin is racist, but that last one is also bigoted (which is the difference).

funny,c8welw1,"No one is going to be arrested for having a songbird feather collection they got while in Boy Scouts out hiking; the law is antiquated and originally served its purpose because of the rampant slaughtering of birds in the 1800s-1900s for the purpose of using their feathers in fancy hats. The thing that is most likely to get you in trouble is is you try to sell those feathers (though you still don't want to advertise a big feather collection, for example.) 
 It's very rare for people to get in trouble, because one guy picking up a blue jay feather is not what they want to discourage or really care about. It's one guy harvesting blue jays for profit. 
 The ""care-o-meter"" rises when the bird is 
 
 A charismatic species (something not endangered, but if like a state bird or something) 
 An endangered/more-protected species (like a Whooping Crane- they will nail you to the wall for shooting a Whooping Crane) 
 Or a bird of prey like a hawk or owl (or eagle- most convictions of this sort come from people shooting bald eagles, which happens more than one would think.) 
 
 In all this, taking a mockingbird out of your back yard and putting it in a cage will most likely end up with a wildlife officer telling you to release it, or maybe a slap on the wrist.

funny,co9n6l3,"Obligatory: Hey, guys, I found the hipster! 
 But Reddit, at least, has had a pretty consistent view of the ethos of the hipster: 
 First, a hipster is one who adopts something -- be it an item of clothing, a hairstyle, a hobby, or apparently a neighborhood --  ironically.  As far as I can tell, this means they adopt it  because  it's unfashionable, as if to make fun of it. Inevitably, enough hipsters start doing this that they make the thing fashionable after all. 
 Second, a hipster is the sort of person who was into something obscure ""before it was cool,"" and who will immediately shun what is  currently  cool. The hipster might admit to liking Nickelback, but only the early stuff, before they sold out. 
 Third, hipsters are inherently nonconformist, which probably lead to the first few points. As such, they  hate  being called hipsters, and are exactly the sort of people who will reply to a comment about hipsters with a comment about ""true hipsters"" and a graph of how hipster one is. They are, at least, smart enough to see [this trap]( but unable to escape it. 
 Of course, Reddit is every bit as superficial and judgmental as the rest of the planet, so Reddit has started interpreting ""hipster"" less by how they think, and more by what they look -- it's become less about ""before it was cool"" and more about the hipster beard. I think that's actually wrong.

 It's because he's not a performer, really. 
 He's a product, just like Britney Spears, and countless other 'pop stars' that have existed before him, and will exist after him. 
 It's sad, because 'Justin Bieber' is no human being. He was 'plucked' and marketed like anything else. 
 I work (unfortunately and temporarily) in advertising. When discussing a new product, we will look at our target market, what has worked in the past, what current trends will possibly affect the product and how we may need to adapt it. We'll think about where the target market might see it and promote it there. We use clever copy and image design/layout to maximise what the consumer (note the use of that word) will see. 
 If you look at the way 'Justin Bieber' is promoted as a product, it's no different. He's an attractive young man with charisma. That's the first check - we can promote this to teenage girls who probably have disposable income. We can promote this to the parents of said teenage girls who will nag and moan until the parent gives in and buys Justin Bieber tickets/calendars/tshirts/cds/posters/books/dildos (delete were appropriate). 
 And then when Justin Bieber doesn't act like a rational human being, everyone gives him a hard time about it. 
 Well what do we all expect? 
 Those who buy into this bullshit can't see it, but if they could, I would think they'd be ashamed of themselves, but then, it's not as if they realise what they are doing. Those who take these people, and LITERALLY see pound/dollar signs, are the ones who should be  really  ashamed. In fact, I genuinely think the world would be a better place if they killed themselves.

 Edit: Oh sure, I'm not denying that he's not talented. He's more talented at singing, playing instruments, being musical etc than I am. For sure. 
 My point is that he was plucked from the possibility of him becoming someone truly creative, because of his appeal as a product. He, his parents, his friends and his relatives (and probably most of his fans) likely think that Justin Bieber is a successful person, he is doing well, he's got a good life, but I honestly disagree. I think he's been exploited beyond what a normal human can handle, and it's obviously gotten to his head.

 I don't think German policies would have resulted in substantially more environmental protection than we had historically.

During the war they turned all of the industry they could into weapons factories, and basically looted trucks, tanks, planes, anything they could get their hands on and brought it to service.

It gets even more complicated considering what Hitler had promised regarding Libensraum in Russia, were they going to resettle Western Russia with Germans? I'm not sure. 
 It's my opinion that Germany would have done a worse time rebuilding the economies of Europe than was done by the Marshall Plan. They didn't have the resources the US had and they wouldn't have the cooperation either. And I doubt that partisan activities in occupied countries would disappear, so that would disrupt the economies as well.

funny,c5chooo,"As someone who has spent a masters and PhD studying behavioural adaptation (the more neutral term for this that makes no assumptions about ""risk"" being the important factor) I came here looking for this. 
 What is important to note is that Risk Homoeostasis Theory is (as the name suggests) the Theory (put forward by Gerry Wilde) and Risk Compensation is what it predicts. However, despite the rather enthusiastic wikipedia page linked above, this particular theory is extremely controversial and also tied up in anti-regulation ideology and the proponents of anti-regulation ideology who understandably love the idea that safety regulation doesn't help. 
 As I mentioned above there is a more neutral term which is ""behavioural adaptation"" which is much more accepted in the Traffic Psychology and Traffic Safety field. This is simply the fact that people are not lumps of non-reactive matter and will adapt their behaviour to changes in the world. This can lead to safety measures not producing as much effect as perhaps would be expected. The important point here though is (and this was roughly the conclusion of a OECD report on the phenomena in 1990 -  that there is no good reliable evidence that behavioural adaptation occurs in the total compensation method predicted by Risk Homoeostasis theory. That is to say that while some measures may have their theoretical impact reduced there is little evidence to suggest that it is totally removed. 
 To specifically address the funny image there is also very limited evidence for behavioural adaptation to 'passive safety' or 'injury prevention' devices like an airbag. Rather, most of the evidence is for 'active safety' or 'accident prevention' interventions like ABS brakes or increasing lighting on streets (although even here the evidence is controversial at times). 
 One suggested reason for this is that in order for behavioural adaptation to occur then one of the requirements is that the driver is aware of the change. In the case of airbags maybe the driver knows their car has airbags when they first buy it but then it is not something that they are aware of (consciously or unconsciously, there is also argument here) when going about their day to day driving. Therefore it does not impact on their behaviour. Whereas suddenly coming into a better lit road at night may have a more immediate impact. 
 For some alternate theories on behavioural adaptation I recommend looking up Zero-Risk Theory ( Risk Avoidance Theory ( Task Difficulty Homoeostasis ( the multiple comfort zone model ( or the Situational Control Framework ( Although there are many others and they all have issues (as you can also in my PhD thesis later this year if you are interested). 
 Also if you are interested in the history of theory development driver behaviour in general then there are some excellent reviews by Michon ( Ranney ( and Rothengatter ( that are available. I am also publishing a chapter on more contemporary models sometime this year (a more extensive version of which will appear in my PhD thesis).","Risk Homoeostasis Theory is controversial and not well proven.

 >But, the fact that they're so overpriced, that they were completely proprietary for so >long, and are still mostly a walled garden. 
 I don't get where everyone gets this idea of propriety. That's an over-simplification. There are so many facets to consider: hardware, software, etc. You have to remember, the Mac was never meant to be a PC clone. It was created at a time when everyone was engineering their own systems, using different methods and ideas. Really, it was a time of innovation. Today, PC clones use generic parts. In some cases, Macs do too, sometimes they come up with their own solution. 
 During the first Jobs era, it was thought that there should be no need for a user to open the computer to repair or upgrade parts. So, yes, expansion choices were kind of narrow. Still, 3rd party hardware existed and exists. Sonnet, for example, made processor upgrade cards. Some Macs had expansion slots, some didn't. Don't forget the original iMac was among the first USB machines offered, which improved the number of peripherals available. 
 Macs today use the same standard parts most other manufacturers use-- industry standard hard drives, SATA connectors and all, etc. 
 > Even on the phones, you still can't insure the screen, and you're not allowed to >switch out the battery... wtf is that about? As far as the users go, you're all good. >You're exactly who should be using Apple. No muss, no fuss, no need to learn. Just >consider the extra cost a convenience tax and move on with your day. 
 They use a lot of non-standard parts, too; things have to be engineered to fit as cases get smaller and smaller. Apple seems to be very focused on the aesthetics of their devices, so rather than modify the device to fit a standard part, they engineer a part to fit the packaging. This is one of the reasons why the battery isn't user-serviceable in the iPhone and the newer portables. 
 It takes space to engineer latches and retaining clips; making the battery internal improves the aesthetics. It's a tradeoff. User friendly versus tech friendly. 
 Another point on hardware: where Apple is making the component or working with the manufacturer to make the component, the drivers are written by people who know what they're doing. To be sure, you do have KEXTs that cause kernel panics. But in my experience, more rare than conflicts on my Windows boxes. 
 Not sure what the deal with the screens is, other than Apple likely wants to control who is replacing the parts and is in receiving and reconditioning devices. IE, you're not shipping to a depot who might do a shoddy job and put a subpar device back on the market. That, and I am sure they want to push you to AppleCare. 
 You may be right with your ""convenience tax"" comment. I'm willing to pay it, because the computer really is a pleasure to use. It gets out of my way and does it's job.

 Yeah, nothing to refute here. This just isn't a strong market for Apple. Outside of media and video production, the xServe wasn't massively popular. The WebObjects software inherited from NeXT was implemented by a number of large companies, though. I'm actually disappointed that Apple has pulled out of the server market... 
 > But, good news for you, Mac's are now chock full of viruses. Yay, you're in the big >leagues now. 
 I wouldn't say they are chock full of viruses. There have always been proof-of-concepts, full-scale viruses and vulnerabilites on Macs. You can't engineer or plan for every eventuality. When it comes down to it, on any system, the vulnerability is actually the user. Most of the modern threats for the Mac are attached to popular pirated software. The same rules apply to the Mac as to Windows: behave yourself, always trust the source, know what you're installing. OS X has always had a mechanism (like UAC on Windows) that requires you, whether you are logged in as an admin or a standard user, to authorize an installer to make changes to system files (System folders, startup folders, cron, et al.) You usually have to provide permission to become infected... rarely does it just happen. 
 > For me, I'm a gamer, so Macs are next to useless. I don't hate them as machines, I >just ignore them. 
 This is a good point. In some hardware, Apple tends to throttle back their GPUs and CPUs in before the SMC will spin the fans up to max RPM. It's that ever-present battery life-versus-performance aspect. The real problem with gaming on the Mac is that Apple lost a lot of it's relevance in the 90s. Market share was lost to Windows, and the development of applications and games followed. It's rebounding though. My sister and her husband are avid gamers on the Mac. 
 I appreciate that you don't hate on the Mac. So many people I've met in my CompSci courses have such venomous things to say about Macs and their POVs are usually based on misinformation and lack of understanding.

We fought, argued, ignored eachother, and were bound to never talk to each other again. Well, we worked it out, then we got married and because of the break-up have a much stronger understanding of what it means to have the other person. I attribute how successful our marriage has been due to that break up. Also we've been married for 3 years, and that was during my 4 years in the military(I met her before the military shes a civy).

funny,cf16r1w,"I sort of know your situation. My mom has 2 sisters and 2 brothers. My grandmother always treated them much better than my mom, all of her life. Instead of being happy for my mom, she would resent that good things weren't happening for her instead.. for example, my mom and a family friend started dating (my parents had been divorced for many years by this time), and this family friend was neighbors with my grandma, so they'd always drink beer together and chat. Anyway, instead of being happy for my mom for finding true love, she hated her for ""taking her friend away"". My grandma would always lend money to my aunts and uncles, but not my mother. Would always talk highly of them but not my mother. These people (who I don't consider family anymore) only ever cared about themselves and were greedy. They even backstabbed each other. I remember even as a kid how fucked shit was. Anyway, fast forward years later, my grandma became very ill. Guess who was the only one willing to take care of her.. my mother. She opened her home, time, and money to her mom, so she could not only make her last time on earth comfortable, but to maybe somehow repair their odd relationship. My grandma finally passed.. her other kids never really even bothered to visit her in the hospital until that day. My mother took care of all of the paperwork, bills etc after her death. Then comes the fun part in all of this. In her will, she left her cottage home to all 5 of her kids in a way that it cannot be sold unless all 5 agree to do so. And my grandma knew from the beginning that it would be a shitfest to get all of them to agree on  anything  let alone that. Another option is that they could buy each other out of their share. Since my mom wanted out of that situation, she proposed they buy her out.. then they could all control what was done to it and have it to use. Nope. They refused to. There is no way for her to get out of that trap unless they all end up dying before her. Now she doesn't talk to them or consider them her family, and neither do I because I always witnessed what was going on.. throughout my childhood into adulthood. Apparently even the four of her brothers and sisters don't get along now because they are always fighting over control.

 To get a college education, one needs money. One can pay out of pocket, with loans, or with grants.

funny,c6bkfc6,"This reminds me of one of my favorite stories. I went to a high school where many of my peers felt the need to constantly remind others that they were so cool. It didn't help that there were only 200 people in my graduating class, so everyone knew each other. I didn't really care all that much about being popular, I had a small group of friends who valued me as a friend and that was all I needed to be happy. 
 So my Senior year in gym class we were playing a game called matball. I won't go into the rules but I'm sure some of you have played a variation of it. There was this girl in my class named Leslie, she thought she was the absolute shit because dudes let her suck their dicks and she had a D1 soccer scholarship. I had known this girl since 6th grade but I wasn't friends with her and didn't talk to her frequently. So she was pitching during the game, I was on the other team and was on third base. I got a lead off from the mat, and this pissed Leslie off because I was being ""competitive"" and she kept calling me a douchebag. This continued for awhile because whoever she was pitching to was having trouble putting the ball into play. So I kept getting a bigger and bigger lead off before each pitch. Finally Leslie couldn't take it anymore and threw the ball at me and missed terribly. She picked the ball back up and walked back to the pitchers spot. I took another giant lead. She stares at me then begins yelling at me ""You're such a douchebag nobody thinks you are funny! blah blah blah"" At that point everyone's attention was on the 2 of us. As soon as she was done yelling at me, I yelled as loud as I could, ""Shut up and throw the ball Lindsey!!!""

funny,c8mn91t,"Maybe, but at this juncture I don't think that the general public not having an immediate use for horses (or the capacity to keep them) necessarily changes the view (of many ppl, but not all*) that they are companion animals. This is in-part because of the human-horse history and because they still feature in human-animal companion fantasy's (not in a sick way -.- lol) e.g anyone who has ever ""I want a pony"" even though modern life doesn't allow one to indulge for whatever cost/space/experience reasons (and may instead settle for watching a show or race). 
 Of course the line is blurry, for example, people can have a strong companionship with their horse and still decide that if it gets too old/ill/dangerous/expensive (more so than the usual!) and otherwise would need to be put down - that the doggers do an equally good job for a cost benefit as opposed to a loss...and a very large corpse that is hard to dispose of. 
 The sad fact is that there are a lot of unwanted horses and it is not innately bad that these horses, which might otherwise be mistreated, get a quick death and become dogfood....or maybe even a horseburger. But on the other hand I don't think we can just say ""yes, horse meat for everyone!"" simply because we think we  should  have moved past the stage where horses are a companion animal (as though the natural progression is towards eating everything :P). The relationship between human and horse has developed over thousands of years - they have been food, transport and entertainment yet despite this (or perhaps because of this) the horse has earned it's current relationship(s) with humans, that is not easily untangled. 
 We are better acknowledging that the human affinity for the horse probably means horse-meat will be a 'tricky area', instead of saying ""it shouldn't be."" Because while there IS a place for horse meat, it is rather against human nature to rapidly reevaluate and 'overcome' a mechanism (the companion animal type) that has a long-evolution and manifests itself through trademark social behaviours like attachment (with a healthy dose of anthropomorphism :P)... All this is similar to dog meat I guess - but that's another can of worms.","Horse meat has a place, but we should acknowledge that horse meat will always be a 'tricky-area', we can't just say ""it shouldn't be"" as the horse human relationship has been a long-evolution culminating is a complicated/tangled mess that is supported by the strong social nature of both human and horse.

funny,c8eqkgu,"Time is as valuable as money, if not more. You're exploiting the Time Value of money by investing it in opportunities that return the capital over time with interest. 
 With our economy, there is a demand for money (in form of loans and such) in order to complete transactions (eg: buying a house). At any given time, someone somewhere needs money to do something. If you have a surplus of money that you can't use immediately then you can lend that money to someone in return for a small percent interest when they're done with it. 
 This process is made much easier by banks who combine loans, mortgages and other investments into single funds, like mutual funds and whatnot. You basically lend your money to the bank so they can lend it out accordingly (safer too since they'll go through the necessary steps to make sure the investments are safe). 
 If you don't invest and just put it into a no-interest savings (equivalent of cash under the mattress) then you are actually losing money, even if the balance is the same. This is because you are losing the time-value of money. This theory is based on inflation/deflation of goods over periods of time. It's more radical in short term when considering loans which are often paid off in short term.","The money you have is useful somewhere, even if you aren't using it. Therefore the act of having money over a period of time has value to it as well. This value can be traded just like real money.

funny,c5yr2c2,"It's largely made up of fatty acids, which consist for the largest part out of alkane (saturated fatty acids) or alkene (unsaturated fatty acids) chains, with an acetic acid-like head group. 
 This means that, using very informal reasoning, their density likely lies somewhere between that of diesel fuel (roughly 830 grams per liter) and acetic acid (1050 g/l), tending more towards the diesel. 
 The reason the density of alkane chains is lower than that of water is that they only attract each other very weakly, since their interaction is purely based on the Van Der Waals force (or London Dispersion, if you're from the UK or the US). On the other hand, the interaction between water molecules, as well as the interaction between acetic acid molecules and between the head groups of fatty acids are based on dipolar interactions. Since these molecules/groups contain an asymetric charge distribution they interact somewhat like magnets, which means they attract each others more strongly. The result of this is that they are drawn closer together and the density goes up.","on a molecular level, butter looks like diesel with acetic acid head groups.

 Friend of a friend decided to move down here and share a room in an apartment with said friend. They were going to share a room and the spot flor the new huys mattress was previously occupied by an old ratty couch. Being the nice guy that I am, and also the only person they knew with a truck, they asked me to help haul the old couch to a dumpster in exchange for a few beers. I happily obliged. 
 So the guy who moved down here insisted on carrying the old couch out of the apartment by himself for some reason. He did this by flipping the couch over and resting it on his head, by putting his head where the cushions would be. He got the couch to the truck and rested the forward arm of siad couch on the edge of the tailgate, still upside down. He then backed his way out from under the couch to the rear arm rest and stood up. He decided, I suppose, that it would be easier to then ""flip"" the rest of the couch over itself (to land right-side up), than it would be to just slide the rest of the couch into the bed of the truck. 
 What this gentlemen did not account for was that my truck only has a 6.5' long bed, and apperently the couch was longer. So I had been sitting in the drivers seat of the truck, and by the time I turned to look over my right shoulder and see what was happening, it was too late.

funny,c85hm1m,"My father's company did the entire plumbing for a local house that they did, I believe it was in Altamonte Springs, FL. It was done in 2006, I was in 8th grade at the time and thought it was the coolest thing in the world that my dad was working with the cast! I didn't see him for about a month... When his company got the call they were in shock that his company was being recruited for the show. At the time business was booming and my families company had the money to donate, we've been asked since then to do other houses but have had to decline. 
 Anyways, 3 weeks before the work began my dads company actually started the work. It was pretty crazy, he actually had the entire crew lay out all the pipes for the entire house and glue, solder, etc everything together. It took about 10 crews (20-25 people) to finish just the original set up. When the time came to start, my dads company got the entire area dug up in a matter of only a few hours. They dropped in the pipe and everything fit into place. To make a long story short, my fathers company actually got everything ahead of schedule by about 18 hours. It was the only show that I can remember (and at the time I watched the show religiously) that they didn't have a panic about not finishing on time. 
 Now the sad part; doing this cost my family about $50,000 in time, material, and labor. No big deal, expect the show had promised that my families company would have their name mentioned in the credits on TV and that since they had put them so far ahead of schedule that they would mention the company name during the actual show. All in all, none of it happened, they didn't even show the pipe getting put in. The only part of my dads company you saw was his face in the crowd of hundreds. 
 The even sadder part was that my dad ruined the show for me. At the time I was young and actually believed that the cast worked on the house the entire week, in reality, they put in about 8 hours a piece. My dad was  lucky  enough to work with Ty on a few projects; just because the plumbing was done didn't mean he got to come home. I remember going to the set when everything was going on and he was so busy he couldn't even come give me a hug. But to this day, we still do not regret helping the family out. 
 Also, they only lived in the house for about 3 months before they had to move because they could not afford to keep up with it.

funny,chcjbgs,"I am a Canadian. I have lived here all my life but I have visited and experienced various cultures all over the world. Aside from all the ""Sorry"" cliches and the stereotype of us being pushovers, It has almost nothing to do with weakness or feigned/sarcastic politeness and everything to to with patience. If you bump into a Canadian or accidentally short change him at the till and he apologizes, It is not a sign of submission or an admission of guilt, It is actually used as a vernacular way of stating that you are not upset towards the person.
Example: you are at the counter at timmie's ordering a large double double, and as soon as the cashier hands you your beverage you clumsily drop it and it spills everywhere. The cashier will nearly always instinctively reply with""Sorry!"" although it was not all her fault and now has to clean it up.
The use of ""sorry"" was used by the cashier as a message reassuring you that she is not upset with you and that you are forgiven. It's kind of a less accusatory way of responding to an accident without placing blame.","Sorry"" in Canada is not an admission of guilt, it is to express that the speaker is not angered by the other person's mistake."

funny,cb6jp27,"How speed limits work is they are tied to the 85th percentile. This means that speed limits are supposed to represent the average flow of traffic. If people drive faster, then the speed limit goes up. If people drive slower then the speed limit goes down. 
 But there is a catch. The federal government pays a percent of the roads for states. This percent is tied to the state max speed limit. If the state max speed limit is 55mph then all (or almost all) of the roads are paid for by the federal government. If the state max speed limit is 60 then X percent is knocked off. This goes up till I think 80 or 85 mph when the state starts paying for the roads entirely. I'd give the numbers, but they change usually every year. 
 Anyways, this leaves states with a max speed limit that is not tied to the 85th percentile. This is dangerous. It kills people and increases the number of accidents. 
 This means that when the speed limit is a state max speed limit (not like 35mph) then the average flow of traffic is often faster than the speed limit. This needs to be identified to find the real speed limit of the road. If you follow the signs strictly the chance of you killing yourself increases drastically. Safety isn't in speed, but average flow of traffic. If you're going to slow you're as likely of getting in an accident as someone else going too fast outside of the average speed.",State max speed limits are often a lie. They are not the real speed limit. Following that speed limit causes accidents and police officers are not going to ticket you for speeding if you're going faster than the marked speed limit and staying within the proper speed limit that should be written.

funny,c3xj68v,"I'm curious about why you would equate abortion to murder and then say that there can be reason for it if the mother's life is at risk.  How ""at risk"" need her life be before there is acceptable ""reason"" for ""murder""?  Can you point to an analogy between say, an mother and her newborn where there is ever acceptable reason to kill the baby to potentially save the mother? 
 I understand your belief regarding life commencing at conception, but I fail to grasp the logic behind how you could allow for exceptions to an act you equate with murder based not on the status of the ""victim,"" but on the status of the one you see as the perpetrator of that murder. 
 If you're looking for objectivity without someone telling you ""you're just plain wrong because I disagree"", I'll give it a shot: 
 The definition of what constitutes a human life is subjective.  The criteria that attributes value to a human life is also subjective.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you base it on a combination of genetics and at minimum the  potential  to become an independent human being with all (or at least many) of the characteristics that are commonly associated with ""being a human being."" 
 You're entitled to your definition and criteria, but because an embryo and early term foetus lacks most of the characteristics commonly associated with qualifying as a human being, your opinion is not universal, nor is it any more or less valid than anyone else's opinion.  It's clearly a question of morals to you (given that you feel abortion qualifies as murder), but again, the point at which you have drawn that line of morality does not necessarily line up with where others would draw that same line.  That being the case, abortion may not be a question of morals (though it may remain one of ethics) to someone who draws that line at some point after conception.  Only after that arbitrary line do moral considerations come into play. 
 Your definition of human life only takes into account the most basic requirements of human existence to elevate consideration of that life to a place of moral consideration.  It's a view you're entitled to, but just to compare, my definition of human life deserving of moral consideration requires that the human entity in question be capable of rudimentary thought and feeling.  Rationally, I cannot equate the value of a human embryo or early term foetus to that of newborn or even late term foetus because until somewhere in the ballpark of 16-18 weeks gestation, it utterly lacks the ability to feel pain or think at even the most basic level.   It is entirely lacking in all aspects of the capacity to know anything of or meaningfully experience its own existence, let alone know anything of or meaningfully experience the end of its existence. 
 Is it not because other people meaningfully experience their existence that killing another person is seen as such a reprehensible act?  I'll grant that you may in fact disagree, but if it's not the complex psychology of being human that makes us so ""important"" to ourselves and one another, what is it?  Nothing more than their chromosomes and the potential to go on living?  What makes that special vs. say, the life of a non-human organism? 
 There's really only one answer to what makes rudimentary humanity anything special: Belief that it is so, intrinsically.  Whether that belief stems from your independent conclusions or philosophical/religious considerations, your beliefs and the moral imperatives that come of them are no more or less righteous than mine.  Both are subjective, and so we come full circle to what the heck to do about it. 
 You're free to believe whatever it is you believe and it's okay to be biased on account of your beliefs.  The only objectivity I'd encourage you to worry about is whether or not you believe that it's okay for someone to impose the moral implications of beliefs that you find totally unreasonable and unfounded on you in the most personal and meaningful matters of your life as those who are pro-life generally wish to impose upon those who find their moral beliefs totally unreasonable and unfounded.  ""Denial of the right to life"" may be the most succinct and accurate definition of murder in your mind, but it's based on not only your personal beliefs about when a human life begins, but also your equating a human life with a human being, regardless of the presence or absence of the very attributes you'd likely name in defining yourself as human, in which case, can you at least see why someone else might define human life by different criteria than your own even if you don't agree with that definition? 
 Dayum, that was long.","You're entitled to your opinion, but it is just that.  Given the differing opinions on when human life begins or becomes significant, it wouldn't be just for anyone to go around imposing their beliefs on anyone else, particularly when differing beliefs are wholly moral by the definition of human life/human being that supports them."

Well, Bobby is starting to get offended, and that's when Alex drops another bombshell ""You're so fat, your parents didn't even want you!  That's why they dumped you on your grandmother!""

 In the sense that the word ""due"" usually means something that you owe, or need to pay, the phrase ""making due"" seems to be an acceptable usage to me in this specific instance. As in ""barely making payments on their debts"". ""Making their dues"" would most likely clear up any confusion. 
 However, boppamowmowmow, the phrase ""making do"" would also seem to be correct here. As in ""who are barely getting by"", as ""making do"" is used. ""Do"" is most often the correct spelling of the word in the idiom. However, in this edge case, it can be interpreted either way, and I think that either spelling is not incorrect.

Also he has only had one of them for a year and the other one is pretty much dead silent.  The thing that bugs us is that this person left an anonymous letter and then threatened his dogs.

 this shit started on 4chan's /co/ comics and cartoons, because of a blog(?) post that bashed lauren fausts talents in the new ""my little pony"", so they streamed the first episode, and a few people from /co/ got some tripcodes and started tripfagging in /co/ about my little pony (obviously not seriously, just trolling) for some reason, the show caught on, and when the mods got fed up, they went to /b/, which is way more popular, where it got most of the attention. 
 obviously, some of the first fansites came from /co/, but most of the bronies come from /b/ or the obscene amount of branding that bronies give themselves (e.g. bragging to friends(yes, stupid, i know), linking it over facebook etc.)

funny,coyu4ly,"Hopefully, this little color comparison I did might help a bit: 
 Your visual cortex is interpreting a white dress being held in dim bluish light in front of a bright background. 
 Instead, it's a dark blue dress lit by dim gold light, being imaged by a particularly shitty camera with its exposure value turned up WAY too high! 
 It's  entirely  dependent upon  the scene  you're visualizing, not the dress itself. 
 Sort of like this old optical illusion: 
 One thing is for sure though: 
 The manufacturer of that dress could make a KILLING if they started to produce a blue and gold version.

funny,c446a6u,"No, I understand.  And I apologize, I knew my post sounded harsher than I intended, but I couldn't think of a good way to reword it.  It's tricky trying to qualify concepts of right and wrong.  I'm not a fan of absolutism, but I understand why the law doesn't make a distinction because doing something wrong with good intentions is a pretty dangerous line to walk.  Now, intent  can  factor in to legal concerns, but at the court level.  From a legal standpoint, particularly in regards to enforcement, things pretty much have to be black or white because what you're doing is still illegal.  Once you start making exceptions for certain circumstances that seem reasonable, you're devaluing the crime altogether. At least, that's how they look at it. 
 Morally, it's another story entirely and one that's just as, if not more, tricky.  Do the ends justify the means? Is it okay to do bad things now, if you intend to ""make up for it"" later?  Personally, I live by an ""honor"" code, where the specifics of a given situation aren't nearly as important as the principle of the matter, because I know me.  I'm a tricky bastard. Once I start justifying things that are reasonable, it won't be long until I'm finding ways to justify things that aren't.  I think most people are prone to this in the long run, which is I why I like to spend so much time dissecting stuff like this.  It helps establish the line. 
 The war on drugs thing is kind of a good analogy in that the users should definitely not be punished as severely as the distributors. But it doesn't really work in this case, as there's no way to ""make up for"" drug offenses and in any case, you can't undo a crime with a legal act. 
 There may be some wiggle room if we can get legislation modernized, in that, if I've bought a copy of a movie, I should have the rights to personally use it in whatever form I choose.  I wish it were the case that by owning my own copy, I can download a digital copy somewhere and have the right to it, but legally, that's not currently the case and it's dumb.  This is the sentiment that, I believe, drives a lot of the people around here who pirate.  The thing is, just because you disagree with a law, doesn't mean its okay to break it.  You've got to have a really good reason (like, saving a life).  Entertainment simply isn't that important.","I know I kind of rambled here): From the moral side of things, if you purchase legit copies of stuff you've pirated, yes, that's better than never paying for stuff because you don't ""have to"".  It doesn't invalidate the crime, but it does mitigate it to a degree.  If there were a moral hierarchy (which is a fucked up concept that I'm loathe to employ), it would go: unrepentant pirates < pirates who ""compensate"" < people who simply wait until they buy/accept the risk of purchase"

It spiraled out of control when people kept thinking they'd be wise to respond to the sender with ""please don't send me this,"" when obviously the right move would be to let the supervisor know, and ignore the original messages, which is what I did. Since my job was based on receiving e-mail notifications, it was getting to be a legitimate problem, having sift through and delete emails all day. But nobody was doing anything about it...except continuing to reply! This lasted for a couple days. I was fairly new and kinda shy so I thought, Here's my chance to bring this to the attention of the higher-ups while at the same time making everybody laugh and hopefully let my nearby co-workers realize I'm a funny guy.

I started receiving feedback from people at the company's various international offices, telling me I cracked them up, how funny my e-mail was, I brightened their day, etc., (also telling me how they too weren't dumb enough to reply to the original mail). Turns out the higher-ups weren't a fan of my e-mail. I was fired almost immediately. (I was a temp anyway.) They fired me over the weekend by telling my agency they didn't want me back. The agency called me, but I didn't get the message, so I went in Monday and my badge wouldn't swipe. My now ex-supervisor had to come break the news.  That  was an awkward morning.

funny,ckpbggj,"Your parents pushed education because it's the truth:  You have a better chance to succeed with a degree.  It's up to you to pick a relevant one. 
 The degree itself is only a quarter of the way there.  Employers are not going to meet you at your graduation and beg you to come work for them.  Securing a career is a full time job, and it's at this task that your generation is lazy and entitled. 
 So you got a degree, good job.  Maybe you even did a tiny bit of research and picked a relevant degree, better yet.  Now what?  Have you sought out the knowledge of how to write a resume relevant to your career choice?  Are you actively searching (as in spending at least 4 hours a day) for a realistic entry-mid level position?  Are you dressing and acting appropriately for interviews?  For that matter, have you figured out interviewing techniques?

 You should have started this long ago, not now that you've graduated.  Less parties, and less whining about your situation would have helped immensely.  So you have a 5-6 figure student debt.. ok.

The 20-25 million others were a result of ideological rigidity and bad bureaucracy, therefore unintentional and based on a long history of starvation in inland China.  Also, of the number who died not because of incompetence, probably half were either in war or because another kind of incompetence, one stemming from the fact he didn't realize how out of control his Cultural Revolution would get.","The fact it was during the Cold War changes nothing and that logic absolves the Germans for WW1; Mao was not a mass murderer on the level of Stalin, mainly just incompetent."

Hell, I'm not sure I'd feel like I got my money's worth if I didn't disembark with a stiff neck and a troubling numbness in my legs. Still, my  worst  in-flight experience didn't come as the result of any such  expected  inconvenience, but rather at the hands of someone trying to be nice. 
 I was about eight years old, and although I can't recall what destination my family had chosen, I doubt if I'll ever forget the time that I spent on that flight. Due to some issue or another with our tickets, the four of us - myself, my younger brother, my mother, and my father - had been seated in seemingly random spots throughout the airplane... and none of us were next to each other. This would have been fine if it hadn't been for the fact that my neighbor was an incredibly attractive young woman who seemed to be entirely oblivious to every rule that governed polite society. 
 Or, at least, every rule as they were understood by an eight-year-old. 
 Within moments of sitting down next to the girl, she'd done her best to engage me in conversation. I knew that I wasn't supposed to speak to strangers, and thus her friendly small-talk made me very uncomfortable... not, as you might think, because I was wary of dialogue with her, but because I knew that my parents might walk by and catch me. 
 Her next transgression was taking out  and turning on  her Walkman while the plane was in the process of taking off. (For those of you who may not recall, a Walkman was like an iPod, except that it could only hold about two dozen songs and it had a tendency to transform them into spaghetti.) I can remember scrambling to grab the safety pamphlet from the seat in front of me, then frantically pointing at the section that warned about electronic devices being inactive during takeoff. The girl just smiled reassuringly and kept right on with her forbidden activity, causing me to grip my armrest in terror. 
 If that had been the end of things, I might have escaped without the psychological scarring that I still carry... but unfortunately, the young woman was far from finished. About midway through the flight, she dug through her purse and pulled out a small package of something, which she opened with a nonchalant smile. 
 ""Max,"" she said to me, ""would you like a cherry cough drop?"" 
 Alarm bells rang in my head like they never had before. My mother had always told me that  any stranger  who offered me  medicine  was gearing up to do some  very nasty  things to me. She had never specified what those nasty things  were , but I knew that they had to be truly abhorrent. Maybe, though,  just maybe , the girl didn't realize that cough drops  were  medicine, and was simply one of those people who ate them for their flavor. I'd heard legends of folks like that, and if it happened that my seat-mate was one of them, maybe this was an opportunity for education. 
 ""Oh, no, no thank you,"" I replied. ""I'm not sick or anything."" 
 ""Okay!"" the girl said brightly. 
 ""... Are  you  sick?"" I asked, hoping to prod the conversation forward. (In the face of this new potential threat, I'd all but forgotten about not talking to strangers.) 
 The young woman shook her head. ""Nope!"" 
 I felt the panic in my chest start to subside. ""Then why are you eating cough drops? They're  medicine , you know."" 
 ""Oh, I know!"" the girl said with a laugh. ""But they taste wonderful, and they help me relax."" 
 The klaxons in my head started blaring with renewed vigor. Not only was this stranger talking to me, but she was  also  one of those people who ate medicine for fun... and she was  trying to offer me some!  I'd been warned about all three of those things, but never in my life had I expected to meet such a threatening trifecta of terror.

 You'll often get the sweet old lady to just doesn't understand their bill, but you'll also get the screaming woman with crying baby on their lap and feral children running amok in the background while an equally loud husband yells obscenities toward his wife hoping that the rep on the other side will hear it. 
 Customer service, contrary to popular belief is not a right, not any more. In the olden day of yore, when one bad experience with a customer could sink the local merchant and he'd never find business again is gone. 
 You get out of customer service what you put into it, if you call into a call center and get me, I'll do everything in my power to help you get the issue resolved, but if the first words out of your mouth when you call me is an insult, or a racial slur, or you are screaming so loud, that it sounds so much like dying cat, my co-worker three cubicles over just popped their head up and asked if my phone was broken, i'm less likely to give two shits about you. 
 I will weather it, I have to, I'm QA'd on these calls and I have to try to help you, and I've had many a time when a customer calls in yelling and screaming at me and I've managed to calm then down enough that I can solve their problem in 5 minutes. 
 I have been called a cocksucker by a customer simply because his services were disconnected, he hadn't paid us in 6 months, ignored 2 late notices, 1 final notice and just as many phone calls - but  I'M  the one giving bad "" customer service "" when i refuse your offer to pay the debt over the course of another 6 months. I i realize shit happens, family emergencies happen, medical emergencies happen, hell - natural disasters happen and I know people are busy when these things happen, but honestly, you can't expect a company to do nothing after 6 months with no word from the customer - we have no idea what is happening in your life, we just know you're overdue and we want our money. 
 if you can't pay your bill because you are in a situation where it's difficult,  CALL US  - we're more then happy to make payment arrangements and hold late fees or extend a due date because you just lost your job, but be reasonable and we'll be reasonable too. 
 People who have bad experiences with call centers, or any customer services situation need to take a second, collect their thoughts and rationally discuss the problem. 
 When people call in mad and then get put on hold for a long time, it's not always because the rep is looking into you're account, 9/10 times, they can solve your problem, they probably dealt with the exact same problem earlier that day, or week, or month. They probably put you on hold because their eardrums needed to rest after the verbal assault they just weathered. It's also (sometimes) to give you and the rep a chance to chill the fuck out for a few minutes before the battle starts anew. 
 I've had a customer who thought they were being billed the same time period by two companies and yelled at me for 5 minutes before I patiently asked him to read back the to and from dates of his billing on each statement from each company, only for him to realize that yes, the bill print date and the due dates were the same on each bill, but the actual time period in question was billed for different dates. 
 he was a joy, after I calmly explained it to him and he started to understand what had happened, he apologized and we had a good chat afterwards and explained steps to avoid it and educated the customer how to read his bill so that further mistakes won't happen. 
 But not everyone is like that 
 The blood and feces lady was a charm to deal with, the crazy religion lady is a call center favorite, I kind of miss Mr. G, he was a peach, pretty sure he's mentally unstable, because he'd call 30 or 40 times a night and just scream at call center agents - police had to be involved in that one, when the rumor on the call center floor was spreading that he was on the prowl again, every call you got was verbal roulette, you never knew if the ball would land on lucky Mr. G.","Customer Service"" isn't getting what you want, it's getting told what you want can't be done in a dignified way.

 Conversely, I went to a restaurant with my wife who has kind of picky tastes lol but she was feeling adventurous and ordered a new dish. She didn't like the meal so I told the waiter and only asked for some more of what we had for an appetizer. Not only were we not charged for the meal, the manager came and offered their house soup complimentary. So we left a tip for the price of both items we were given plus the gratuity. Also worth mentioning that both the waiter and manager we're extremely pleasant and did a lot to make our evening there better.","I like to have the flexibilty to show my servers how much I appreciate their service or how much I didn't.

funny,c9hlyzi,"It's rough but here goes: 
 It was a normal day on the drilling operation in lectularius 5. Billy was at his usual post on Zygomatic Ridge, monitoring for any possible disturbances from the land. Todays operation was particularly important because the nymph hatching season was fast approaching, and the colony would soon find itself in a dire situation without adequate sustenance. The evening was quiet and cool, with only the gentle rise and fall of the land as it pulled in air through and released it loudly behind him. Below Billy could hear the chatter of his brood mates acting as quickly as possible to bring their lifeblood to the surface without disturbing the land enough to cause it to panic, and roll which could result in major losses to their colony. 
 Billy looked at the moon through the open window and felt the cool night air rush across the face of the ridge while he waited and prayed. It had been a few seasons since he had last seen the invaders that flew. The ones the competed for the same resources and slaughtered their young. He thought of his own little nymph back home, who relied on his returning with fresh food nightly in order to survive. He took a deep sigh, and began his trek back down the ridge to report in when he first heard it. 
 The unmistakable high pitched drone that he had heard once before. He felt his breath catch in his throat, but only for a moment, before he turned towards the worker group and yelled ""GET DOWN, INCOMING FLYER FORCE!"" within moments the swarm was upon them, pulling and climbing, clamoring for their hard earned drilling sites, throwing billy's comrades off of the edge into the soft fuzzy abyss that no-one ever returned from. 
 Amid the cries of his brothers Billy began charging down the ridge towards Philtrum Valley, as he ran he screamed the loudest battle cry he could muster. This only seemed to pull more from the sky towards Billy, their long spear-like faces aiming to skewer Billy before he could even begin to defend the failing group. Billy dodged the first few attackers as with only minor wounds. He managed to leap onto one of the flyers and tear away one of its wings before it could take off again. It shrieked in pain and attempted to fly, but in vain. As its one remaining wing flapped it flipped the beast onto its back. Billy didn't waste time, he went for the throat, ripping its throat out with his beak like rostrum, and then quickly dove for cover as the land seemed to inhale the husk of the beast into its two massive caverns. This seemed to upset the land causing it to rumble, spasm, and make a loud momentary hacking sound before returning to its calm monotone movements. Billy could just see parts of the beast fly from the void to his right as the land heaved and hacked, as if some massive monster had consumed the beast. 
 Billy didn't have time to think though. The flyers were closing in, angered by Billy's kill. They began pushing him back up Zygomatic Ridge, swiping their spear like faces as they closed in for the kill. Billy fought back as bravely as he could crying for re-enforcements all the while. He managed to wound a few of the beasts while being scratched a few times, nothing he couldn't handle. finally he was pushed up the Ridge and over until he found himself with his back to the only place no bed-bug dare climb... Septum Peak. He pulled himself up the wall of the Ridge, and as he began to climb he felt the searing pain of one of the spears penetrating his back. He knew he had been wounded mortally, but he had to find a way to draw the flying beasts away from his home, and his beloved nymph son. As he climbed he realized he was completely trapped, it was hopeless, and barring some divine intervention he would die knowing that his beloved colony would soon follow. He began to pray, but there was nothing, and in a moment of sheer panic he began to try to dig for shelter. Straight into the peak. Clawing. Pulling. Trying to find anything to survive. 
 Billy could feel his consciousness fading and the beasts seemed content to watch him die struggling. He did not care, he continued to dig until he collapsed and rolled upon his back. It was in that moment, that he felt the earth shake and rumble that he realized that the ground he was mining was not the ground at all, but a massive monster... A monster that he had now angered... his ultimate weapon. And as his eyes closed for the last time, he could see the hand of the monster, like the hand of a enraged god, was coming down to crush his enemies. He closed his eyes and smiled as the quick, immediate, warm impact, crushed them all.",You punched yourself in the face because something tickled your nose
funny,c46axfp,"I have no idea whether you're a male or female... nor the person above you.. which means there really isn't anything that you've said to make it apparent which one you are, as it should be if you are to be judged simply by what you wrote. 
 There are very few times where mentioning your gender really helps your cause or your argument, it just generally doesn't matter. So if you're saying something that does make it obvious, the argument goes (ie, what the 4chan guy is saying), that you're trying to go back to gaining an advantage. I'm not commenting on the abuse, ie, a girl speaks in a game and gets a ""go in the kitchen"" joke because.. well... that's not what the OP was talking about, he was talking about girls making it obvious that they're girls to go back to gianing that societal advantage. So it's odd that your comment got so many upvotes because your comment isn't really relevant to the argument. 
 As for that abuse... i generally think the white knighters make it harder on the girls to integrate. Here's the thing about the internet: we all get abused. Whether you're a young kid, an old guy, a guy with a squeeky voice, a high pitched voice, you suck at the game... whatever it is you're gonna get shit for it. That's just how it is. The trial by fire is whether you'll be able to weather it and not just crumble like a little girl (ho ho). Girls simply aren't used to being treated this way because they're perceived generally as more disarming. It's why we probably prefer female waitresses and why people would rather see pictures of girls representing their gym than some sweaty dude. If you want them to be treated the same then let them go through the shit. If they pass the social exam and are seen to be ""cool"" enough to be integrated, they will be, like any of us. It's like when you go to a YMCA for the first time to play basketball or something... everyone there knows each other etc... you go there and have to sit on the bench and wait until they're ready to give you a try and then you just kind of have to prove yourself. I think guys/white-knighters are a little too feminine in that they can't stand to see a little bit of discomfort in the girls when they go through the same stuff we all do and in general the girls don't want to go through that same discomfort we all do either, so it's a cycle of indulgence. But that's a whole other issue..",Let them go through the abuse like the rest of us.
funny,cfrdsf7,"When I was in the third grade I wanted one of these for my Barbie doll sooo badly. Every time we went to Sears I went over to the sporting goods section to make sure the models of the tents were still there. 
 On one visit I managed to work up enough nerve to ask the salesman/cashier if I could buy or have one. I had $5, my birthday money, with me and I thought maybe he'd sell me the smallest of the model tents for $5. He told me no and he interrupted me when I tried to say more. He didn't give me a chance to explain why I wanted and needed one of the mini tents. 
 I then tried to convince my father to go ask the salesman about the tent but he would not. No one understood how important it was to me at the time. I left the store feeling hopelessly defeated. 
 The next week I found out my friend Kathy's father worked at Sears. Hope was restored, I felt like if she and I asked her father, who was a friendly man, that he'd help us. Kathy usually got whatever she wanted. She had like 10 Barbie dolls, I had one. She had a lot of toys, her parents doted on her. I was sure we'd both get a mini tent, positive that Kathy's dad would say yes to us. I mean how could he say no to this request from his daughter that always got what she wanted? 
 The next time I was at Kathy's house Kathy and I went to ask her dad about the tent, actually we'd decided to ask for two, one for Kathy and one for me. I felt like we had these tents in the bag. I was already daydreaming about camping gear and playing with the tent in my backyard. It was going to be sooo great! 
 All hope was crushed when Kathy's father told us no, he could not get the tents for us. He could not ask the manager to save one for us. He worked in the automotive department and had a different manager. He was sorry but he would not and could not help us. 
 I never did get a cool perfect little mini tent for my Barbie. I'm in my fifties now and still and hate seeing the model tents in stores. Seeing them reminds me of how I failed in my quest for a tent for my Barbie all those decades ago. 
 My Barbie camped in a modified tissue box. I'm sure she was humiliated but she never complained. 
 For a very brief moment I hated OP when I saw this post. Then I came to my senses and shifted all my hate to whoever threw that tent out. Some young girl or boy NEEDS that tent. How on earth could anyone be so stupid that they'd toss that out? 
 I'm glad you found the tent and I hope you'll find someone to give the tent to that will make good use of it.",OP is a lucky bastard and I'm a failure in Barbies eyes.

funny,ch6xlqq,"Belize City - I was only there for the airport.  My bag was going to get searched until the customs officer saw my granola bars and asked if he could have some.  This is where most people stay in Belize, or out to the islands along the barrier reef. 
 Orange Walk - We went to this city a few times to get supplies and to do some shopping.  One of the larger cities in Belize.  It was fun, a couple of good restaurants, tons of shops, always felt safe.  It is your typical small city in a poor country.  All of the roads and highways are dirt.  Driving along the ""highway"" (also dirt, terrible condition, speed bumps constantly) you see a very strange dichotomy.  There will be huge, beautiful mansions, sort of gated off compounds and literally right next to them will be a shack with walls and roof made out of corrugated tin or rusted steel.  From the richest of the rich to the poorest of the poor just like that.  I've heard that land and construction costs are dirt cheap in Belize so there's that. 
 August Pine Ridge - This is the city we did our volunteer work at.  It was extremely small and very poor.  Lots of wide open land, dust kicked up from pickup trucks that run on propane, chickens and dogs running around.  Children walking to school, some with uniforms some not, some with shoes some not, some lucky enough to have their ""classroom"" be under some shaded palm trees, some not.  Small shops that had a weird assortment of packaged food.  Belize will never run out of Tang.  They also would have great hand made things like frozen chocolate dipped bananas, tamarinds dipped in chili powder etc.  All of the people we met were extremely friendly (except one drunkard late at night, the locals called him ""Jimmy Loco"") and fed us like kings while we were there.  I suspect many of them killed their prized chickens to feed us and ate only rice, beans and tortillas for themselves.  The food was AMAZING but I got hit hard by Montezuma when I got home.  I probably would've gotten tired of the food eventually since it was all very similar.  The locals operated on ""Belize time"" - so if we all decided as a group we would meet at 6:00 am the next morning we wouldn't see the non-american workers until at least 7:30.  Just the way they operate there, laid back and stress free.  Every evening the entire village would go out to the soccer field and play for hours, they had generators to make sure the field lights always ran.  The hero of the town was a young man who played for a Belize pro team a few towns over.  I remember one of the things that surprised me the most was a very strong Mennonite population that bought up huge amounts of land to farm and ranch.  Their horse drawn carts were all over the area I was in.","Overall Belize is very interesting mix of rich and poor, the people are very friendly, the beer is cheap and I've heard the beaches and islands are stunningly beautiful."

Personally i think gun laws should be a lot stricter, i just don't like blame being thrown around at people who dont deserve it. Every gun shop owner i have met has been a kind caring member of society. Never has one of them meant any harm in what they were doing. They sell firearms and accessories because it is their passion, it makes them happy that other people can enjoy the sport. My father was in several branches of the armed forces and is an avid shooter. When i was 16 a military service edition Henry rifle was released that was absolutely gorgeous, and i knew my father would love it, so i saved everything i could, but before i had enough they were set to stop being sold. I went to the shop and talked it out with the owner, explained everything about what i wanted to do, and he gave me a nearly 600 dollar discount. He wasn't in it for the money, but the love of it. When i brought my dad in to sign the paperwork for that rifle i have never seen a man happier. That was the one day in my life i saw my ex-marine father cry out of happiness. 
 Look at Japan. They had 11 gun related deaths in 2006. They have the strictest laws on gun control ever created. It IS proven that gun control limits the number of gun related deaths, it keeps the irresponsible people from getting their hands on weapons. 
 I myself am a proud firearm owner, and i take incredible care with them at all times. I have never had an accident involving a firearm because i am careful, and treat them with respect. The problem is people thinking they are a game, brandishing them around and showing off and getting careless. So by all means, make it near impossible to obtain firearms. Make me take an incredibly difficult test every year to keep what i have. I don't mind because i will study my ass off to pass, and if i can't pass i will relinquish them knowing i shouldn't have them. 
 My problem isn't with gun control laws, it is with people like you who point fingers and think guns are the problem. They generalize everything and try to criminalize anyone who sees things slightly different. Saying guns cause violence is like saying McDonalds gave you diabetes because it was delicious. The problem lies with people who refuse to take responsibility and the laws that let people buy them so easily.

 When you say, "" I  find you attractive"" the focus is all on  you  (the one handing out the card) instead of on the receiver.

It has an air of unwarranted self-importance. 
 The cards that say ""You are beautiful"" seem much nicer to me. For one, the focus is on the receiver. It sounds less like a judgement or appraisal of them. Also, the word ""beautiful"" has a totally different connotation. ""Attractive"" is usually associated with physical attraction, desire, and sex.

 By this, I mean assuming (not an anthropologist) that the ice bridge from asia allowed a crossover into north america, and again assuming that these were the first inhabitants, by this definition the first infant born would be the only native.  Since every infant born after the first would not have been here before the first, there would only be one true native. 
 How far does native land extend, in this concept?  Is it the current demarcations that the north americans of present use, for instance if you were born within utah do your people own utah?

Where light works much like a side of the scale, where it can not only help with life and growth, it can also consume or deteriorate objects.  Darkness, is the same in another way, it can consume life with its lack of light and also provide other organisms life, much like acids and base. 
 My point being that much like light and dark, acid and base has the same representation.  The scale can tip both ways and the other side helps in balancing as everything is in motion and can not be purely ""balanced""  just as in there is no true balance between acid and base, there is no true balance between light and dark, or energy and lack there of.  Energy is balancing and not balanced, the act of balance can never be balanced as it is balancing.

 truth is, her co-workers are behaving like dicks towards her. This behavior is not appropriate for work. 
 I don't think my point is hard to comprehend.  maybe i'm saying it wrong, i don't know. but it is not acceptable. 
 also, bathroom paper towels on her back, garbage and stickers as she works in and around food is probably a health code violation of some sort.  this kind of behavior is fire-able in my book. just saying","the stickers themselves aren't malicious. The behavior is. it is also inappropriate for a workplace, and it makes the person with the stickers the unwitting butt of the joke for her coworkers amusement. and also puts her in the position of being the publicly mocked and ridiculed person in the workplace in front of all the customers who may come into contact with her that day. 
 unless she concented to this kind of silly behavior, the behavior was malicious and inappropriate, her coworkers covered her with garbage and let her stay that way for hours without telling her for their amusement. do you not see how this is not a reasonable thing to do to your coworker?"

funny,ck54nic,"I was homeschooled until I was 14, and as of now I'm in advanced placement classes in the best private school. 
 I'm now 17 and my grades are currently wavering around 90-95 percent. I'm not socially stunted in any way, I have many friends too. Also, I wasn't living in North America. Wrong assumption there.
I think that homeschooling is often far better than normal schooling, so long as the parent teaches and teaches at the child's pace. 
 For academics, I was ahead of the normal curriculum by around a grade or more. For english, I was reading the classics (the works of Charles Dickins, Animal Farm, 1984, The Great Gatsby, and American lit) by 10 years old, so I was incredibly advanced in my writing skills. My science skills were subpar in comparison, around the same grade level as normal kids, but I loved (and still love) physics and concepts that concerned space. At 14, I was learning calculus, just devouring textbooks of math one at a time. World History interested me too, so i'd read a lot of history textbooks for fun. 
 When I transitioned to a ""normal"" private school, I was placed in all the advanced classes. I could've skipped a grade but my French was an issue, considering I'd just moved to Quebec.
Still though, it was a bit hard to adjust to how easy the classes were in comparison, and how I had to learn how to fistbump instead of handshake. It wasn't too much of an issue though. 
 However.... 
 If you compare my homeschooling to the homeschooling of my Uncle's grandsons...
Hoo boy. They were homeschooling for all the wrong reasons. First, they were religious nuts. Second, they had two kids who were in different grades. That's tough to teach. What's more, the nutty mother said that ""she finishes with them by lunchtime"". Two different grades to teach... By lunchtime? What the hell. We'd wake up at around 10 and work until dinnertime. Anyways, me and my brothers play monopoly with the 8 year old guy who was ever so brilliantly homeschooled by his mother... 
 Damn. That kid was stupid. I mean, really, really stupid. He could barely speak properly, but it wasn't a speech impairment. It was as if his mother hadn't given him proper social interaction, leaving him with only his younger sister to develop his speech. Worse, he could barely add or subtract in Monopoly, even when it was as simple as counting out $120. He read the ""community chest"" cards really slowly. He could barely read, and I was reading 200 page books at that age. Later, my uncle boasted about how the two were just great at memorising scripture, a very pointed boast at us (our family aren't really religious types). Sure enough, the 8 year old was great at reciting scripture, but nothing else.","Homeschooling is great and all but you've got to be doing it for education, not religion

 From your comments, it sounds pretty clear you've never spoken with a  real politician.

Seriously, if you are being a good politician and doing what is necessary to strike the balance needed to spend the available money to provide the necessary services all while wasting as little resources as possible, you are going to piss  at least  60% of the electorate off by ""not doing enough"" or ""going too far to the other side,"" which is exactly in the middle. 
 You spend easily 50% of your personal resources on finding out what the hell the public  actually  wants and thinks, because the people who tell you what they want are usually playing for something (and represent a very small fraction of the voting populace), and the people who vote generally are too busy with their own lives to actually provide you any feedback, as they don't think it will do any good anyway.

You get to be in a position where you can directly influence the type of community (or nation) you want to live in, and you can direct and prioritize the resources to develop what you think would be the best benefit to your locality.

>   Less lemon juice than you'd think (any citrus juice, added no more than 1/2 tsp at a time)
>   When I'm feeling fancy, I grate some zest and add it with the second addition of liquids

 Life may be exceedingly rare in the universe, multi cellular life even more so. Finally intelligent life may mostly end in ecosystem specific intelligence 99.999999% of the time.

funny,c2hsljw,"Yes. I'm in the mental health field so I want to start with the criteria that should be metin order to diagnose asperger's but I also want to describe how those traits are exhibited by my sister. Diagnostically, asperger's looks something like this: 
 [The following is from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM IV] 
 (I) Qualitative impairment in social interaction,as manifested by at least two of the following: 
 (A) marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze,facial expression,body posture,and gestures to regulate social interaction (B) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level (C) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment,interest or achievements with other people,(e.g.. by a lack of showing,bringing,or pointing out objects of interest to other people) (D) lack of social or emotional reciprocity 
 (II) Restricted repetitive & stereotyped patterns of behavior,interests and activities,as manifested by at least one of the following: 
 (A) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus (B) apparently inflexible adherence to specific,nonfunctional routines or rituals (C) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g. hand or finger flapping or twisting,or complexwhole-body movements) (D) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects 
 (III) The disturbance causes clinically significant impairments in social, occupational,or other important areas of functioning. 
 (IV) There is no clinically significant general delay in language (E.G. single words used by age 2 years,communicative phrases used by age 3 years) 
 (V) There is no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or in the development of age-appropriate self help skills,adaptive behavior (other than in social interaction) and curiosity about the environment in childhood. 
 (VI) Criteria are not met for another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder or Schizophrenia. 
 My sister: 
 She has never been able to make good eye contact. Even in photos. She can now (after a lot of work) make fleeting eye contact, with family. Her facial expressions are often incongruent with what she is saying. She doesn't gesture. At all. She gets stuck on how weird and unnecessary it is when others do it. 
 She is often very literal and struggles with metaphor or anything going on under the surface. She is incapable of putting herself in someone else's shoes or understanding their point of view. Sometimes this looks like she is self centered or doesn't have a conscience but that isn't it. She is just so inside of herself and literal that she can't see things from any other perspective. If I talk about something she already knows about, she doesn't want to hear it and will say so. There is no reason to listen because she isn't learning something new. 
 She cannot read social cues and is horribly socially awkward yet oblivious to it. She has a narrow range of interests that become obsessions and these things dominate all of her thoughts and interactions. She needs routine. If she is overstimulated or things don't go the way they 'should' or someone/thing is wrong, she experiences debilitating anxiety and has meltdowns that look something like a cross between a nervous breakdown and a tantrum. She can't really break the rules or lie because when she does, that is doing something wrong and she falls apart. She takes things very seriously. If I tell her that rabies is passed through animal bites without explaining it further and she gets an animal bite, then her literal logic will tell her she has rabies. 
 She posts things on facebook but doesn't really share anything because she isn't trying to engage or interact with anyone really. Even if no one could see her wall she'd do the same things. She just doesn't have that connection or relation to others. I told her that I posted her video on a site that I liked and that a lot of people watched it and she said, ""That is dumb, dude."" (I'm female. She calls everyone dude now, even the cats). She thinks that her video is just a factually inaccurate  video made by a kid who is obsessed with JFK. She can't see what anyone else would like about it. 
 She is one of the smartest, most brilliant people I know. When she was a preschooler, she told me the entire process of making ethanol. She blows my mind regularly but outsiders see a girl who is really weird, possibly autistic, and rambles on about one thing without properly interacting with anyone. Parents don't like or understand that she has no filter at all when it comes to what she says or does. If it seems like the correct thing to her, she can't keep it in. I'd love to be more like her, though, and I mean that.","Asperger's is a trip and my sister is pretty much a rockstar.

funny,c4nt5xo,"What you have to remember is that these scholarships come from that community. If the JACL was sponsoring grants for outstanding Japanese students, that's their investment from their own community, to their own community. 
 The problem is that there is this collective of white people that say ""This isn't fair, I can't have that"" which is true to some extent. I doubt it would go well if there was a White citizens league. 
 But see, I think the problem might be more of the fact that there's this community of Japanese in the JACL, full with their own set of racial community service or culture and tradition. Same with African Americans, same with Jewish people. 
 But the term White people is just extremely broad and general, because what exactly is a ""White people""? If I would ask one of my friends, he/she might respond ""I'm 1/4 Irish, 1/8th German, 1/8th French, 1/4 Russian, 1/8 Polish, 1/16 British, etc."", where instead of having that culture and community of their race, they have the American White culture. 
 Now there are plenty scholarships that you can apply for as a US Citizen, that I wouldn't be able to because I'm not yet a citizen, although I live here. 
 But I'd be able to apply for my own racial scholarship if I follow that community. From my own understanding, you have to have a significant presence in the scholarship you apply for, such as Filipino Youth Leadership or something (as in, I wouldn't be able to just be Filipino and apply, I'd have to do some service work in the Filipino community). 
 So while people that aren't White do get some extra help, don't act like it's dragging you down. 
 I'm not saying that people of colored descent are all foreigners, a massive load are American-born that get these scholarships. What I'm saying is that it isn't unfair for our own communities to take the initiative and re-invest in the kids. If there was a German or Italian scholarship (or whatever lwatson74 is) then it wouldn't be unfair. It's just if you want equality, but you're 34 different strains of 'White', then you would seriously rather cut aid for other people?

 In many places there's now an unfounded opinion that the government can be sued, or that it's agents can be sued for carrying out actions which are illegal in the course of their duties. This is not actually true, it is only in special circumstances where the government allows itself or its agents to be held accountable (police brutality, for example).",what the government does isn't illegal because the government is the law.
funny,cbkdzl4,"But therein lies the difference of what most people are saying (including you) and what OP has said.  OP talks about  draining  a tank.  Draining a tank can be done via many methods.  The issue people have with what OP has posted really has to do with if this can come from gravity draining a tank or not. I do not doubt at all that  pumping  liquid out of a tank will cause a low enough internal pressure to implode a tank.  However I highly doubt a simple gravity drain will cause the same problem, in a tank such as this one. 
 [Consider this quick drawing](  We have a tank of water with some internal atmosphere and a magical one-way drain that lets water out, nothing in, and does not affect the water flow at all.  The 14.7 psia in the left corner is atmospheric pressure.  In order for the water to flow out of the valve, the pressure inside the valve must be greater than 14.7 psia outside.  The pressure there depends only on the pressure from the water and the pressure from the atmosphere in the tank, which are summed at that point.  Finding the water pressure is easy, it is entirely dependent on height.  It turns out that at about 27.67 inches of depth in water you have 1 psia of pressure from the water.  So 33.89 feet of water height is needed to have enough pressure to equal atmospheric.  What this means is that if the tank was completely full of water with no air  no water comes out  unless the top of the water is 33.89 feet or more above the outlet.  The train car in this GIF is clearly well below 33 ft in height. 
 ""But wait,"" you may ask, ""What if there was some air in there to start with?"" 
 Well, if there is air in there to start with then that adds to the pressure and can assist the water in leaving.  Lets assume the top of the tank is 15 ft above the drain.  We will allow 1 foot of air at the top of the tank.  So the water provides 14 feet of pressure or about 6.07 psia at the outlet.  That means at 8.63 psia of air in the tank we are at equilibrium.  No water moves out because the pressures are equal.  But what is interesting here is the dynamic effect as the water drains.  Before this equilibrium point, the water was higher and provided more pressure, but also the same amount of air was occupying less space so the air pressure in the tank was higher.  If we knew the geometry of the tank and the point at which equilibrium was reached we could calculate the starting pressure given the initial height of the water.  What if the water reaches equilibrium lower though?  At 2 feet of water, the water provides only .867 psia leaving 13.833 psia of air in the tank.  Interesting that the lower the equilibrium point, the higher the end pressure in the tank is.  So what if there is only one inch of air?  That is 6.47 psia from the water and 8.23 psia of air.  Now the question is at what point does the tank crumple?  8.23 psia of air inside and  outside is a differential pressure of 6.47psi.  Is that 6.47psid enough to crush the tank?  It's possible the tank is that susceptible to outside pressures, but look at how fast the tank collapses in the GIF.  There is no way that a mostly full tank of water was emptied that quickly during the collapse. 
 Ultimately, OP is right that a tank  can  be collapsed by a gravity drain, but there needs to be a large height difference from the tank to the drain outlet to allow the water to have enough pressure to overcome atmospheric pressure and thus escape the tank and leave a low enough pressure behind to cause a collapse.  In fact, the references that OP sight all seem to deal with tanks that are either very high or very tall.  This is where gravity draining can be an issue.  A railroad tanker at about 12 to 15 feet just doesn't have the height to have this come from a gravity drain.  Now pumping can easily overcome the pressure issue and cause very low pressure inside of a mostly or completely empty tank. 
 Many people who are having a problem with OP may not realize that at the appropriate height differences gravity draining can indeed cause a problem such as this GIF shows.  I have a problem with OP because as a person with a self proclaimed ""masters degree in engineering"" he (or she) should have enough sense to pay attention to the sources they sited and see the difference between them and this GIF.  Also, ""I have a masters degree in engineering"" is not a good argument of  any  kind for this, any one can make a mistake.  To be fair, other people also made the same mistake.  Also OP has been unnecessarily rude.  And even more annoying, OP's argument of ""Do you see a source of steam or heat in this video?"" is the dumbest thing I have seen in this thread.  No we don't see a steam source, but we also don't see the end of the hose coming out of the tank!  There could be a pump or a steam source on the other end of it!  Or the hose could just go over a cliff leaving it 60 feet below the tanker allowing gravity to cause this problem.","OP isn't exactly wrong, but he isn't exactly right.  And OP is a bit of an illogical dick.  Source: I have a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering  and  I did the math."

So I spent a lot of time going to doctors and trying loooots of different eardrops and shit.

 Then when the gromit fell out I had to had actual surgery on my ear, they cut open the back of it so they could reach inside. Sometime during the operation I woke up and this one I remember. 
 I shot up, couldn't see shit all, tried to rub my eyes and felt something over it, in a panic I grabbed whatever was on my eye and ripped it off and in the process I dug into my eye with my own fingernail and literally cut my eye, I couldn't see a thing for about 2 months then it started to heal up after that.

When the ovum/yolk mass is ovulated, it is caught by the infundibulum (the end of the oviduct) where fertilization will occur if sperm are present.  Then, the fertilized yolk mass moves into the next segment of the oviduct, called the magnum, in which the ""white"" components are deposited.  Next, it moves to the isthmus where the shell membrane is formed, and then finally to the uterus where the shell develops.

funny,cg7jhvg,"Plinkett  as he reaches his personal lowest point and the Emperor gloats and commands him to kill Vader. Luke realizes his victory was hollowed by his usage of his anger, and rejects the Emperor's command. 
 Nobody realizes it, but at the end of Jedi Luke has a tiny version of Anakin's fall: he gives into his anger and hate to defeat Vader, his former better. This is similar to how Dooku beat Anakin effortlessly in Clones but got beheaded in Sith, and I suspect it's intentional; both Skywalkers tap into the Dark side to defeat a Sith Lord. Yet Anakin goes further off the deep end, whereas Luke looks at his father, crumpled on the Emperor's chamber floor, and rejects that path. But the meaning is lost in both Anakin vs Dooku fights because neither one particularly cares about the other. Dooku didn't kill Anakin's mom, or kidnap Padme, or torture his mentor, or anything else personally evil to Anakin. Sure, he's leading a war machine, and he kidnaps the Chancellor, and he's a Sith Lord, but these aren't personal struggles along the lines of Vader/Luke or Vader/Obi-Wan. The same goes for Obi-Wan+Qui-Gon/Darth Maul; there's no personal vendetta there, no emotion to tap into until Qui-Gon dies. But then Obi-Wan wins pretty much right after, and Darth Maul dies. We don't see Obi-Wan struggle with Qui-Gon's death, we don't see him even try to talk to Maul. Maul never says a word. This doesn't fit in with the OT; in all those fights, people talk during the duels. ""Now I am the master"", ""Join me and we can rule together"", ""I am your father"" - even the smaller lines show the character's familiarity. ""I see you have constructed a new lightsaber."" Vader recognizes Luke's growth as a Jedi, both because he's trying to recruit him and because he's curious as to how he's doing. He's still Luke's father, deep down, and this throwaway line is a massive clue to Vader's eventual turn against the Emperor. There is nothing like this in the prequels. No talking is allowed except for utilitarian commands between Obi-Wan and Anakin. The Yoda/Palpatine fight if done in the style of the OT - standing in a guarded position, neither one sure of the other's move, throwing words back and forth - could have been great, but instead we had an octogenarian and a muppet do backflips in a room full of steel donuts.","OT duels were about the emotional conflict between two characters; Vader's hatred vs Obi-Wan's peace, Luke's desperation vs Vader's determination, Luke's anger vs Palpatine's control.

For a lot of different reasons, the timing isn't right to leave my current employer right now - so, I've spent the last 3 months polishing up my resume and reviewing the classifieds and applying for jobs that I am qualified for - but I have no real interest in accepting if offered.

funny,c41ddel,"thetheist said it very concisely when he said that not all verbs function that same way, but the reason for this has to do with a combination of  Theta Roles  and [Pragmatics]( 
 To talk about the latter as it's less complicated than the former, ""fighting with someone"" is grammatically correct because, if you say that to someone, they'll understand precisely what you mean (in English) and this, empirically, is a better test of ""grammatical correctness"" than any style book.  This is, at heart, how the Pragmatic aspect of a language works: the speakers share not only the semantics and grammar and sound system, but also a mutual context by which to understand more nuanced, less literal meaning ( this  is also why words like  this  and  that  function  deictically . 
 (Not very many people are happy with this notion, though, and decry the awful Descriptivists attempting to poison our beautiful language with excessive permissiveness even though, hey presto, language is constructed by the speakers and not the rule-makers.) 
 When it comes to Theta Roles and  thematic relations , the English verb ""to fight"" is semantically different from Latin's ""pugnāre"" because it can take different classes/types of subjects and objects.  While objects of the Latin's ""pugnāre""--the verb indicating that two people are actively engaged in fisticuffs--might only take the role of ""theme"" (a thing undergoing an action without changing in state) and thus would not make literal sense if the object were a prepositional phrase (as this would imply a different meaning of the word ""pugnāre,"" specifically that one person is actively engaged in fisticuffs and using the verb's object as an ""instrument"").  In English semantics, though, we can look at the object of ""to fight"" either in that original sense of Latin's ""pugnāre"" (where an Agent fights a Theme--the Theme being ""someone"") or we can look at ""to fight"" as taking  another Agent .  So the ""with"" doesn't necessarily mean, in English, that that person is being ""used"" in this context (as it would in Latin), but rather that one Agent  along with  another Agent (the ""someone"") are deliberately performing the action of ""fighting.""

You shall not make for yourself a false image, nor any manner of likeness, of anything that is in heaven above, or the earth below, or in the waters below the earth."" 
 ""false"" is misleading translation. the word just means ""idol"". 
 > Asherah is ""Yahweh's"" (in Judaism we just call him God) 
 in judaism, you usually call him ""my lord"",  adonay . i'm not jewish. i'm just reading the bible, and the bible calls him ""yahweh"". 
 > but I don't know any sects of Judaism who believe this. 
 currently, no. pretty much not after about 610 BCE. king josiah of judah was responsible for much of the religious reform that banished idolatry from judah, including asherah worship. asherah worship seems to have been pretty common in israel: 
 >> וַיַּצִּבוּ לָהֶם מַצֵּבֹות וַ אֲשֵׁרִים  עַל כָּל־גִּבְעָה גְבֹהָה וְתַחַת כָּל־עֵץ רַעֲנָֽן 
>> (2 kings 17:10) 
 and even judah: 
 >> וַיֹּצֵא אֶת־הָ אֲשֵׁרָה  מִבֵּית יְהוָה מִחוּץ לִירוּשָׁלִַם אֶל־נַחַל קִדְרֹון וַיִּשְׂרֹף אֹתָהּ בְּנַחַל קִדְרֹון וַיָּדֶק לְעָפָר וַיַּשְׁלֵךְ אֶת־עֲפָרָהּ עַל־קֶבֶר בְּנֵי הָעָֽם׃ 
>> (2 kinds 23:6) 
 the above, of course, is josiah removing asherah from yahweh's own temple. why was asherah in yahweh's temple? because they were married. 
 > Anyways, I'm aware of the incident that you make note of, but that wasn't the first time that the nation of Judah (or nation of Israel--I forget which in this case, but I think it's Judah because I remember Israel having almost no righteous kings) forbade the worship of false idols. 
 well, texts seem to have existed that forbid idol worship, yes. but the deuteronomy (the text hilkiah ""found"" in the temple and gave to josiah) seems to have been the motivating/justifying factor in actually removing idolatry from judah, and forming a monotheist jewish religion out of a monolatrist or henotheistic jewish people. 
 the ""no righteous king in israel"" thing, btw, is because of the sin of jeroboam, the golden calves at bethel and dan. this is, of course, extremely biased of the authors of the book of kings because jerusalem's temple had it's own set of graven images: kerubim, on the ark of the covenant. considering that no gods in the area are actually iconic (the idols represent seats/vehicles or even offerings, not the gods themselves) there is no good reason to think that the calves were any different than the kerubim. 
 >","You bring evidence of a time when, after a long period of time, they started getting rid of false idols, but really, that happened several times much earlier. 
 however, there is no good reason to think that the other incidents were  actually real . rather, they all show hallmarks of being written more or less contemporary to the first temple division of judah/israel, and the reform instituted by hilkiah and josiah. incidents like the golden calf at sinai/horeb are absolutely fictitious histories designed to refer specifically contemporary events, the calves at bethel and dan. the actual exclusion of idolatry and other gods seems to have happened  first  with josiah, and there's no good evidence that it happened prior to that point."
funny,cl09uqt,"Trigger alert: Read edit before continuing. 
 One of my male relatives (I'll call him ""Adam"") was raped last December. Adam was in a bar, drugged and lured back to this guy's apartment to ""smoke a joint"". The city I live in is really weed-friendly and offering people weed isn't unusual. Once in his apartment, the guy, who was a very large man, attacked Adam. Adam ran out into the downtown streets bleeding with nothing on but underwear. The guy chased him and, drugged, Adam had to crawl under a fence to escape, causing lacerations on his back, stomach and chest. Adam was scared if he passed out, the guy would find him and just drag him back to his place to do whatever. So, he hid under a car and did pass out from the drugs for a while. When he woke up, the police saw him and  arrested him  for drunken disorderly. He could have argued it in court, he even had evidence of drugs in his system (Rohypnol), but it would have involved him standing up in front of a room of strangers and detailing the attack, so, he just spent the night in jail (after this horrific event) and paid the fine. He did tell the hospital and they sent advocates who were wonderful, but an officer who was a macho ASSHOLE. This after our family had asked for a female officer. 
 Our society won't allow men to report it. When Adam was raped, the police officer who came to the hospital was reported by the health care workers because he was so cold and flippant about it. He acted like the whole thing was a waste of his time. His manner, language and expressions were like, ""Man up, for fuck's sake."" He asked  repeatedly  about the weed and how many drinks Adam had that night. One of the sexual assault advocates became so angry and upset about the officer's attitude that she left the room and called the police station to demand a replacement. She didn't do this in front of Adam, but she told me she wanted the officer  out of the room  immediately. I honestly don't know if the officer was ever reprimanded. I'm sure they go though training, too, but I suspect it's less about training and more about who that person already is. 
 All I could think about was how many other boys and men out there go through this alone because it's more taboo in this society for them to have been raped than to be a rapist. It's so sad and unjust. 
 This is not to say that women don't go through the same thing every day. It's not to say every time a woman reports a rape that it's handled properly either. 
 I am a woman. 20 years ago I was held hostage in a hotel room for 8 hours, raped repeatedly, punched and choked. I knew the attacker (not well, he was a friend of a friend) who said he was, ""just really drunk"". After the attack, he sent me flowers and gifts, which at the time I thought was actually more bizarre than the rape itself. Later, I found out this is actually not uncommon. 
 The police said since I was drinking underage, I should just ""forget it happened"" and warned me reporting it would be ""more trouble than it's worth"" and ""his words against mine"". The officer said, ""He apologized didn't he? Are you sure things just didn't get out of hand?"" When I said I had bruises and you could see where his hands had been around my neck (he squeezed my neck so tightly you could see the individual fingers in the bruising), they said since I was drinking those bruises ""could be from anything"". They warned me to ""be more careful"". The rapist got no warning. The rapist, by the way, went on to be a successful college football player. When I told a male friend (his former high school football coach) what happened and that I was worried for other girls now that he was on a college campus, the coach said, ""He won't have to rape anyone, they'll be throwing it at him."" 
 My point in bringing this up is that I  really  do feel for any woman, military or otherwise, who goes through this. Just because men get raped too, doesn't mean women are ""always exaggerating"" or lying about rape (I hear this sometimes on reddit). False reporting doesn't mean no one gets raped. It just means there are some fucked up women out there just like there are fucked up men. One doesn't exclude the other. And no reporting, as in the case of many men, doesn't mean men aren't getting raped. It just means they have the added challenge of being forced to hold it all in and have no defense in the court system. 
 Those of us who would never harm someone - male or female - this way have to stick together. We have to stop pretending it doesn't happen in the military and fraternities. If you are military or a frat brother and decent person, like most are, then you should be outraged more than any civie about this sort of thing. You should stand up against the rapists who are tarnishing your institution. Rapists should be more frightened of their own brethren than outside forces. We have to stop thinking that it's a ""man thing"" or a ""woman thing"". It's a  person  thing. 
 Anyway, I guess I've been harboring the thing with my relative (I don't want to get too detailed about him) for a while and seeing him suffer the consequences with no recourse and I wanted to share the story. Maybe another male rape survivor is reading this and knows he's not alone. The stats are not an accurate representation for women and my guess is even much less so for men. Just because it seems like you're alone doesn't mean you are. 
 Side note: I work with organizations in my city that do not treat men, women, transgendered, gays or straights any differently when it comes to sexual abuse or domestic violence. You can come in and get help by professionals who will respect you no matter who you are and take all claims seriously. Men are treated like the women and not belittled, their pain is not minimized because they happen to be male. This is how all shelters and advocacy programs should be run. The rape advocates who were there for Adam were very helpful, kind and treated him just like they would have a woman in the same circumstances. The sexual assault unit detective who contacted my family member after the rape was also very good at her job and took the report seriously.","I am not a victim; I am a rape survivor. Helping men in cases of sexual assault does not minimize what I went through as woman. All men are not rapists just because I was raped. Just because some women lie about rape does not mean all or most women do. Just because it's not reported doesn't mean men aren't being raped. It shouldn't matter who it happened to, people should not be free to violate other human beings, period. 
 Edit: I guess I was absorbed in the comments on here about rape and forgot I was on /r/funny. Not really that funny of a story! I've put a disclaimer at the top so people can stop reading. But it could help someone, so, I'm leaving it, but adding a warning at the top."
funny,c0yv9wo,"Fuck Wells Fargo. My place of employment banks through WF so every payday my gf and I head over there and cash our checks. One day I went in there and they were pressuring me to open an account with them, giving me all the hassle and schpiel they could throw at me while I'm stuck waiting for them to hand me my hard earned cash. One teller lady was particularly persistent even after I had told her that I already bank with someone else... so she calmly explained to me that if I put a bit of information about myself on some paper and let them copy my drivers license that whenever I decided I was ready to bank with them, that all I'd have to do was come in and sign the piece of paper and my bank account would be ready to go. 
 Being the naive 19 year old that I was, I figured, eh what harm could it do since I had planned to switch to them eventually and the lady had reassured me that my info was safely stored in the backroom. 
 Fast forward a week later when I check my mailbox and find a letter from Wells Fargo. I open it up and lo and behold there is a shiny new bank card in there with my name on it! The best part is I didn't even have to sign any documents and they AUTOMATICALLY opened the account for me! Without my permission! So I called the corporate number, explained the fraud that had been committed by their bank, and they assure me that it would be closed as soon as the banking executive with the privilege to close accounts returns from his vacation. Another week goes by and I get a bank statement in the mail. It was an overdraft letter. Since the account had never been closed and since there was no money in it, the bank had charged me an accounting fee which caused me to overdraft. 
 Here comes the best part: When I called the corporate number again and explained what had happened, they had no record of me ever calling there before and passively accused me of making it all up to get out of my overdraft fee. The banker then informed me that I could not close the account unless I physically show up at the bank branch and pay off the $35.00 overdraft fee first, then it could be closed. Needless to say, I WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. And in the end I had to pay a fee for an overdraft that occurred when the bank fraudulently opened up an account under my name. And even when I still go in there to cash my checks, they give me the same old schpiel that got me into that clusterfuck of a failed banking enterprise in the first place. 
 THE END","bank committed fraud by illegally opening an account under my name without my permission. Was told it would promptly be closed, it wasn't and banking fees overdrafted the account which i had to end up paying to close account i never wanted or asked for."
funny,c20rw3v,"I suppose because it's somewhat easier to shoot a handgun? Or at the very least because they are lighter and easier to lift. Again, I'm going off living in an incredibly rural area where the self defence thing is actually very valid - even if someone doesn't hunt, having a gun in the woods is really quite comforting. I, for instance, have no hope of shooting a hunting rifle quickly enough to avoid getting mauled by some unfriendly creature, but at least I'd have some sort of chance with a handgun. 
 But, for argument, say guns were made illegal - like heroin and arguably kinder surprise eggs, for examples - would that solve the issue? People do heroin and eat kinder surprise eggs in the US all the time. Based on that, I assume people who aren't likely to go on a murderous rampage and use guns only for legitimate self-defence or hunting and/or just want to follow the law would no longer have guns. Sure. this would remove accidents and good people gone insane situations, but people who  don't care  about the law but want guns for  whatever  reason, would find some way to get their hands on them - whether by making them at home 
or stealing them from the military or importing them. I feel that this hypothetical law would have only the effect of removing any ability to track/regulate firearms, and hardly reduce the amount of gun violence. 
 Most things work because we in some way trust people - the person with the ccleaver to not suddenly chuck it at your face, the taxi driver remembering to stop when he sees you crossing the street, the pilot to know what he's doing, the chef to not tamper with your food, etc. I feel like nist people who go through the effort to obtain a gun permit - a  lot  of effort, particularly when it comes to handguns - are at least as trustworthy/honest/etc as the average motorist. 
 If you're against guns all together I'm more than likely not going to change your mind on the issue. I've accepted this, but am just tryig to give some rational reasons for guns other than the ""hurrrr durr I'm murikin I get guns wooo constertootion"" I see all the time. 
 ...
I just thought of something else, if guns were to be deemed illegal across the country - and I do believe all states would have to agree on that, (which more than likely would result in a situation similar to the fireworks law where some states have them and others do not, and one can simply drive to one that does and bring them home with relative ease) - but if it were to happen, I think it would only make sense to round up all of the guns already out there, to avoid just encouraging a massive boost to the black market.  There are a  lot  of guns, and I think it'd take nothing short of a military raid to get them all (unless you'd trust people to just willingly hand them all over, which yes it'd seem I would, given my argument above, but I'm assuming that those passing this law would not trust people to own guns in the first place, let alone give them up.) 
 People, they generally don't like military raids. The only two outcomes here are a passive submitting of all firearms to the government (as if they need more fucking guns >->'), or some sort of violent outburst from people trying to snatch the guns from collection centres or keep holding on to their guns.",I think it would do more harm than good to make guns illegal at this point and it's better to be able to at least keep track of most of them.

funny,c0ay98b,"What country could he have chosen then, to represent Borat, or should he have simply made no movie? 
 What's ironic is that despite being so presumptive about every person involved based solely on their ethnic disposition you're crying out for extreme political correctness. 
 The whole point of the film wasn't to slander Kazakhstan, it was to expose racist and idiot Americans as racist idiots by gently coaxing out their prejudices via a supposedly idiotic sympathizer, which it did in spades. 
 Was it right that he totally exploited the villagers from the introduction sequence without being explicit about how stupid he would make them look? Of course not, I think it was shady practice at best and he would have been better off faking the whole thing in a studio with actors, but its his prerogative as a comedic artist. 
 The point being, you're blaming the artist too much for what is ultimately the fault of the American people. 
 To use a supporting example: Paul Verhoeven is well-known for making sci-fi/action satire films that play their concepts with a straight face- Robocop, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers. 
 
 Starship Troopers in particular is noteworthy as it is a satire of propaganda films and a subtle indictment of a fascist military state. 
 We are given a ""Beverly Hills 90210 meets John Wayne in 'The Green Berets' (John Wayne cowboy flick about Vietnam and a great unintentional black comedy) vibe"" and through use of formula storytelling hear a typical tale of an average young man just entering adulthood finding his inner masculinity and leadership on the battle; but all throughout the film we are never explicitly told why the 'bugs' are evil, or even given sufficient evidence to believe they ever actually attacked Earth, as in all propaganda films they are simply ""THE ENEMY."" 
 The constant 4th-wall nudging via interspersed commercials and use of the phrase 'would you like to know more' gives subtle and clear implication that the entire film is nothing more than a recruitment reel for the fictional setting's military; the military attire is clearly modeled after that of the Nazi regime; and any actual warfare is shown to reveal a government with hideously poor military strategy (send lightly armored infantry to die in constant skirmishes whilst hovering above with an inert space armada), poor value on the life of a soldier ""until you're dead or somebody better comes along,"" and is extremely careful to keep almost all government/corporate details out of the proceedings. 
 With all these details planted in the background of a cheesy, conventional teenage melodrama one is able to infer that the film is an indictment of such military states that outright lie to their populace about the realities of warfare. 
 In case you doubt what I'm saying is true as ""ALL ART IS ALWAYS SUBJECTIVE"": 
 From wikipedia, referenced by the audio commentary for the film 
 >In the DVD audio commentary for the film, director Paul Verhoeven states unambiguously that the movie's message is ""War makes fascists of us all"", and that he sees the movie as a satire of American militarism. 
 So even if you don't wish to interpret the film that way that is fine, but understand that it holds up equally well if not better to the explicitly stated interpretation of its own director. 
 (more information in an interview with Verhoeven 
 
 Now why do I bring this tangent up? 
 Because when 'Starship Troopers' was released very few people understood the film was meant to be satirical.  Very  few. 
 Sure, the film made money. It was marketed as a straightforward action movie which on the surface it is, but THE POINT (","here) is that many people honestly believe it is a straightforward action movie and fail to realize the fascist implications (or do and celebrate the film as a proponent of such an ethos). 
 Now whose fault is that? Obviously Verhoeven knew this would be a factor when creating this movie, that some would treat the film as vindication and it would reveal in others still the capacity for facism, but is it then his fault for making a film that reveals such tendencies? 
 No. No it is not. Those elements of humanity existed long before one movie held up a mirror to show its audience those qualities in themselves and those elements will exist long after they are gone. 
 One can argue that if the movie is cited as a direct source of information for one's beliefs in encouraging fascism then it is the film's fault, but I would argue that instead it is the fault of the viewer who claims to receive such information. 
 Not a fault as in a flaw of character, but as in an error of judgment. They have looked to a piece of art designed to document and reveal elements of humanity as a source of genuine information. 
 Whether that error stems from low intelligence, a malleable sense of guillibility, or simple delusion seeking confirmation, doesn't matter. 
 Should Verhoeven then be held responsible, and feel bad for bringing to light such into this world? Maybe, but that is  his  prerogative just the same as it is yours to condemn Baron Cohen for not feeling bad about spreading his own misinformation, but I can assure you that far bigger douchebags than him do so and get paid far better on a daily basis to do far worse. 
 Ultimately poor interpretation is an error that exists within the viewer and if the piece of art in question didn't expose such qualities would remain unexposed or be exposed at a later date. 
 And the  exact  same is true of Borat. People who actually look to a film that by all appearances is a satire for truthful information about Kazakhstan are clearly suffering an error in judgment. 
 And note that I'm not denying your judgment that because Baron Cohen is Jewish and his co-star is Armenian the film is on some level intended as a subversive font of disinformation about Kazakhstan. There is a possibility that there are elements of discrimination at play, but  is that the point of the movie? 
 Nope. Not at all. And it is not as though he would be alone on  either  side of the Jew/Muslim international hate circle, not that that would validate it in any way. 
 Seriously, if you can't get over Borat just because some audience members can't tell their ass from their elbow and Baron Cohen isn't wracked with guilt over it or openly stating racist intent to validate your hatred then pour yourself two shots of whiskey, call your mommy, and try to crawl back into her uterus because I guarantee you that the big bad John Q.

 The root of conversation is converse, but the root of negotiation is negotiate, the root of relation is relate, etc. To go back to those roots - ie to form those nouns from those verbs - the standard/traditional practice is to delete /ion/ (or in speaking to change the /shen/ to /t/ (sorry, no time to access the phonetic alphabet but that's close). 
 The person who says ""conversate"" is applying the same rule in going from conversation to ""conversate"", in other words, regularizing the process. But in standard English it doesn't work because converse/conversation doesn't follow the same rule -- and more generally because standard English is crazily full of exceptions. 
 I don't have a bunch of time right now to think of a lot of other examples ending in /rse/ - maybe you can? But here are a few: reverse, disperse, traverse, coerce (yes, even though it's spelled differently, because it's sound rather than spelling that counts in this instance). 
 Notice how these verbs become nouns through different processes than ""converse"". Reverse/disperse >> reversal/dispersal; coerce >> coercion. Traverse doesn't change (well, in some environments the stress shifts from the 2nd syllable to the first). So, if we were going to be consistent based on the ending /rse/, the noun for ""converse"" should most likely be ""conversal"". But it isn't, because English. 
 Sorry if this isn't fully clear; I can try to explain more later, but I have to rush out now.","English is full of logical inconsistencies; the word ""conversate"" is non-standard but is actually a regularization of a process."
funny,cpwcr2g,"Do you not see the good in copyrights? Do you not see how it protects everyone that is involved? I strongly believe in the free market and for the free market to work laws have to be made. I ask you, how can the free market work if not for copyright laws? 
 Have you been paying attention to mobile gaming on iOS or apps on android? When one game on iOS becomes successful you begin to see clones, dozens of them. Imagine if that was any other form of art. You can make a copy of something so fast these day. Where is the fairness if i make a clone, not a version but a clone, of ""Shake It Off"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"" and I get all the credit do to just sheer luck? Copyrights protect the creators from such things. And not only that, consumers now know where ideas come from and can support the artist they like. 
 As a person working on creating multiple products I can tell you the greatest fear is saying something to the wrong person and being first to market. In the field I want to create in there are very little laws to protect our IP from copies/clones. Our work as creators (and if I may use lightly artist) will be secured (as much as we can) under our company. And through that you can almost say that the company itself is the artist of the product. Thats the same way a record label is the artist of an album or a production company is the artist behind a movie. 
 Your beliefs that these corporations are out for money is not wrong. What is wrong is your belief that this is a bad thing and that your pirating hurts them. A producer/production company is as much an artist as is a director, an actor, a musician, a painter, a developer, ect. is an artist. They have a right to defend their works. They didn't draw first blood, pirates did! It is in that way that pirates have to take responsibility for SOPA as much, if not more, as the corporations. 
 I am not against torrents, and I am not against sharing. What I am against is if you have a product that no one paid for. Those action hurt everyone. The producers, actors, painter, musicians, singers, songwriters, developers, directors, consumers, backers, investors,basically everyone involved with the creation and consumption of media. Because if you don't pay for its creation the producers won't pay. If the producers won't pay, the workers don't get paid. If the workers don't get paid, the product doesn't get made. If the product doesn't get made, the consumer has nothing to watch.","Pirating isn't a model of distribution. Its stealing money from content producers/creators, potentially  defunding creators, and therefore stealing content form consumers. And copyrights are in place to protect the consumer as much as the creator to maintain the operation of the free market."

She happened to be in a wheelchair and New Orleans might be the least wheelchair accessible city in the US.  Cobblestone streets, every building historic and therefore exempt from being updated with ramps and such - a nightmare for anyone who is not able-bodied. 
 We were all in our early 20s, so we decided to go out and get hammered in a dive bar.  This bar was open 24 hours, so by the time we got out of there it was about 9 AM and decent people were on their way to work. 
 I was pushing the wheelchair, mostly as a way to steady myself so I didn't fall over.  I had been drinking for a good solid 12 hours and I was in rough shape.  We were crossing St Charles (a very busy street) and I managed to get the wheelchair caught in some kind of pothole or something.  I was drunkenly wrestling with the thing, and cars were approaching much too rapidly for me to feel good about it. 
 Suddenly, the girl in the wheelchair screams, ""Goddammit, hurry up - I'm worth 50 points!""

I wrote a whole comment on my mobile going through your comments, describing how they showed errors of judgement on your part and explaining the different negative  interpretations of your comments. Unfortunately I deleted some of it. So I'll try to go through a quick run through: 
 The general impression gained from your comments is that you're an insecure person. I gained this impression from your defensiveness, your apparent anger and the statements you've written about your political opinions. Your insecurity is the motive you've been using to keep replying to these comments on reddit.

You don't have to be a genius to know that no two liberals are the same and that the people upset by your comments don't solely comprise of liberals. There are more than likely people from different stages of life from different places in the world in this comment section. Different people are disliking your comments, not just 'liberals', though I'm sure you know that. 
 Basically you're an asshole who probably doesn't have a good theory of mind. This doesn't mean that you're stupid, (even though your political opinions and your responses convey a strong whiff of low intelligence). It just means that you have a low amount of empathy, which leads you to make idiotic judgements.",try to think about how others may interpret what you say and try to think from other people's points of view more.
funny,c5t0f5m,"Signature based security is one of the laughable hilarious parts of the credit card industry. Basically nobody cares about real security (note the lack of a move to pin and chip like the rest of the civilized world). All the issuers care about is moving risk around so when money is stolen the banks (see: Visa/Mastercard are run by the same people who run the big issuing banks) are not on the hook. 
 Since the big risk with cc is chargebacks, its in the credit card aquirier's (not the issuer, these are different) interest to ensure that the person using the cc is the person who owns it. This verification can be used when the owner of the cc puts in a dispute that they made a specific purchase. So the original idea was that the merchant verified the signature on the receipt matches the signature on the card, and later the signature on your photo ID. 
 To have this work, your signature DOES NOT need to be your name or anything really. It needs to be something you can reproduce repeatedly and in a complex enough pattern that someone else cannot easily reproduce it. The best way to do this is with layers. Mine is my initials layered with 3 different symbols with a flourish between eache. It looks very circular. This is such that I know how to make it the same way every time, and it would take a handwriting expert to follow how it was made. If my card is ever used fraudulently, even if the attacker has my signature I've got a good bet they won't draw it the way I do, thus showing them to not be me. 
 So since the aquiriers (the people who handle processing for a merchant) don't want to be on the hook for a chargeback, they give a price discount for merchants who participate in the signature verification program. But since merchants don't usually understand the point, they nearly never check the signature against anything at the time of transaction to prevent fraud. They just get you to sign it so they get the .5% or whatever off their processing fees.","Every time you sign for a CC transaction and the seller doesn't check your sig against your ID or card, its just so they get a discount and provides no security to you.

As a last year med student who next year is going to specialize into psychiatry I must tell the people that are diagnosed with ADHD and ADD this: most (probably around 90%) of you are ‘overdiagnosed’. There is currently a huge debate going on whether ADHD and especially ADD is even an actual disorder or just part of (a) personality (disorder).
The drugs you are prescribed - be it methylphenidate or amphetamines - have not shown to have a different effect on people that are diagnosed with AD(H)D compared to the normal population. Both groups prescribed showed the same effects only in different magnitude. This is also the reason why students these days use these kinds of medication to help with their studying because it works for everyone.
My point is: just because drugs like Adderall have this effect on you doesn’t mean you ‘have’ AD(H)D. Psychiatric disorders are generally not diagnosed this way. They are often scaled, just like depression.
Also I would never give these kinds of mind numbing medication to my children. (yes I tried it myself) I strongly believe it takes the child out of the child. I’d rather try behavioral and dietary therapies first. It is not yet known what kind of effects these types of medication have on the developing brain. 
 PS: I’m not trying to sound like a dick and tell people they’re stupid for saying they got AD(H)D. It’s really the current state of the medicalized western society. Parents don’t accept their children to struggle more in the western school system than others, even though it is shown these kids often excel in different areas. The pharmaceutical companies and ‘commercial’ psychiatric clinics are more than happy to supply them with these drugs and diagnoses.

Once the new driver pushes the gas while they're in drive trying to reverse out the driveway they will panic and press harder. This happens quite frequently and it is easily avoidable with training. You may think it's impossible to screw it up because you have over 1,000+ hours driving. But they have zero experience at the command and it's easy to mess up."

funny,cdsd7wv,"I remember one time, during my retail days, this adorable little blonde girl came up to me looking for an American Girl book. She was so shy and polite, and as any retail worker can tell you, the latter quality is not usually to be found amongst customers. The book wasn't on the shelf, but the system said that there was one in stock, received yesterday. At this point I felt the bottom give out of my stomach, because in yesterday meant it was in one box out of 30 boxes on a pallet, and there were two pallets waiting to be sorted in the back. 
 Now, in theory, the boxes would be marked so that we knew what was in them before they were opened, but, in practice, the distribution center did whatever the fuck they wanted so your odds were maybe 50/50. So I went in the back and dutifully opened and went through every box of children's books we'd gotten the day before, wading through toys, tons of Magic Treehouse, Golden Books, Discovery titles, junior readers, baby books, books for babies, and fuzzy animals, but it was to no avail. 
 I returned to the floor a broken husk of a man, having spent the last 20 minutes up to my elbows in books, to have to tell this sweet little girl that I couldn't find her book. I felt horrible, because usually I worked as inventory and so it was my job to be able to efficiently go through new stock and so I honestly felt like I should have been able to come through for her. She was sad, but I told her that if she came back in a day or two we'd have fully gotten through all of the new stock and it would be out on the shelf right where she could find it. She seemed happy with that, and left with her mother and older sister. 
 Later that evening, as I was sorting the shipment onto library carts, lo and behold, I pulled the book out of the young adults boxes. I felt kind of bad about not being able to give her the book, and it was literally in the very next place I would have looked if I had kept searching. When nobody was looking, I snuck a $20 in between the pages of the book and put it on the shelf exactly where it was supposed to be. 
 It was gone a few days later. I don't know for sure if it was the same little girl that bought that book and discovered that it was hers for free, on me, but I'd certainly like to think so.",Maybe gave a little girl a book and some allowance money.
funny,chvse1m,"Note: WWP  does not  disburse funds directly to vets, nor do they provide any services to vets.  They outsource their marketing and fundraising to for-profit institutions, as a 501.c.3 they pay no taxes on the money they take in, and then all funds are routed to  other  501.c.3s that  do  actually provide services and assistance directly to vets.  However those other institutions have their own overhead and costs, so the result is that for every $1.00 donated to WWP less than $0.39 goes to actually helping vets.

 A cocaine dealer that worked there had 3 little teenies (ages 13-14) that he kept around him, to get sexual favors for cocaine. He worked at our market research company, bringing people in to take surveys; I would give the surveys. 
 One night, he came in with the 3 girls to have them do a survey that they all qualified for; there was only myself, the manager & assistant manager left at that hour, so we each had to survey a different girl. 
 I took mine into a small room, with the door open the whole time, and we went through the survey for an hour, very normal.  Each manager came and left a couple times to drop off paperwork during the process. 
 Soon as we're done, the girls leave, and 10 minutes later an officer shows up. He claims that the girl says I raped her while I was doing the survey.  Now my bosses both know that this makes no sense - the door was open, and they were in there far too often, and it's a small office, etc. And they know me, so they explain to the officer all the details, and he understands. 
 And mind you, the officer also was able to look outside our windows, and see the 3 girls and douchebag out there laughing at us, and the officer also knew that this boy was trouble. So the officer just said ""rip up her survey, she was never here, screw this."" 
 I don't know how he explained to the girl that he didn't believe her, but I do know why this happened, and how well my revenge worked out.

Gave it to the previous boss, and she threw it away, claiming he was too good of a worker to give up. (fuck her, he was raping kids!) 
 But on December 24th, 1998, after the douchebag tried repeatedly to shoot a rubber band in my eye as I was leaving, I shot him back with it and actually hit his eye. He was pissed, and threatened to stab me - thankfully the assistant manager intervened, and asked me to leave. 
 About 15 feet outside our door was a bank, and an old police officer was there.  I asked him what he could do if I told him there was a drug dealer with a big bag of cocaine, weed & a huge knife next door who had just threatened me.  He said he could do a lot, and he did.

funny,ccahpxk,"THEORY FOR WHY GRANDMOTHERS HAVE SECRET DANISH COOKIE TIN SEWING KITS 
Grandmothers love sewing shit, especially for babies, so naturally grandma is going to want to sew baby's first blanket if at all possible. However, there's a catch: because you're a grandma, blue means boys and pink means girls, so you can't sew the blanket until you're SURE of the gender of the baby. Grandma's didn't get an ultrasound when she was pregnant so she doesn't trust them. This means the blanket must be sewn after the baby is born. 
 There are two main times in the year when you give presents: birthdays and Christmas. After the baby is born, Christmas is going to be the next big present-giving occasion. So a month before Christmas, now that grandma knows what color of blanket to make, she can go Christmas crazy. She normally decorates pretty well for Christmas but because she just scored another grandbaby, she is absolutely high on tradition. 
 While at the store picking up a fruit cake, a yule log, candy canes, egg nog, mixed nuts, etc., she spies those Royal Dansk Danish Butter Cookie Tins that are advertised heavily around Christmas time. They're expensive, so she wouldn't normally buy them, but it seems like something maybe HER grandmother used to get around Christmas, and she's ravenous from sewing 16 hours a day, so she buys them. 
 Back at home, Grandma is working steadily on the baby blanket, nibbling cookies as she goes along. As she finishes the last stitch and eats the final cookie, she has two problems: 1) there's a terrible tangle of sewing supplies on the table and the new baby might eat a needle if she doesn't clean up carefully, and 2) she ate the whole goddamn tin of cookies and nobody can ever know because she's a lady. 
 And then a brilliant idea creeps into her mind that solves all of her problems: hide the needles in the tin and hide the tin on a high shelf in the closet. 
 And so millions of grandmothers put sewing supplies in a Danish cookie tin in the closet. And millions of grandchildren grow up seeing the most glorious, extravagant cookies tucked away in a closet, just out of reach. And then one fateful day they are finally able to stand on a chair and reach the tin, only to realize they have been salivating over cookies that have not existed since they were an infant.","There are no accidents.

 The balance in protecting kids is to keep the bangs and scrapes and adventures that make up 'learning experiences' and 'character building' in the realm of things that can be readily treated.

 From Merriam Webster: 
>: poor treatment of or violence against people because of their race
: the belief that some races of people are better than others 
 From Dictonary.com: 
>1.
a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to rule others.
2.
a policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering such a doctrine; discrimination.
3.
hatred or intolerance of another race or other races. 
 From Collins American English Dictionary: 
>belief in or doctrine asserting racial differences in character, intelligence, etc. and the superiority of one race over another or others: racist doctrine also, typically, seeks to maintain the supposed purity of a race or the races
    any program or practice of racial discrimination, segregation, etc., specif., such a program or practice that upholds the political or economic domination of one race over another or others
    feelings or actions of hatred and bigotry toward a person or persons because of their race 
 From Wikipedia: 
>Racism is generally defined as actions, practices, or beliefs that consider the human species to be divided into races with shared traits, abilities, or qualities, such as personality, intellect, morality, or other cultural behavioral characteristics, and especially the belief that races can be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to others, or that members of different races should be treated differently. 
 As you can probably see, the main differences between these and the sociological definition of racism is the question of whether or not racism is defined as a systematic socially and government condoned form of discrimination based on race, or whether racism does not necessarily need an institutionalized component to count as racism. According to the above definitions, it does not need to be institutionalized. Racism can be listed as the simple act of dividing people up into races, for the use of associating traits or qualities with certain groups, as opposed to grouping based on biologically determined [clines]( More severe forms of racism, and one might put it, are acts or thoughts of discrimination or negative prejudice based on race, culminating in government condoned institutionalized racism, wherein society and law act together to separate or disenfranchise certain groups based on race. While all agree that institutional racism is a form of racism, these definitions differ from some [sociological definitions]( by saying that while all institutional racism is racism, not all racism has to be institutionalized.

Many  countries have done this by attacking their own fleets with false flag operations to start a war.

At this point, there are people who call themselves feminists who, by the academic definition, have no business calling themselves that, which taint the entire concept of feminism in the first place, largely with misinformation such as ""finding a woman attractive means I'm sexually objectifying her"".

 Liam did say that it can be tactical to go down, either to draw a penalty or give your team a breather.  I think that when deceiving the ref and crying is considered part of a game's strategy, there's a problem.  Same thing is happening in the American basketball league (NBA). 
 Of course rugby and American football have their differences.   But still, as fans we can agree, both are much more physical than soccer. 
 My buddies that play rugby are some of the toughest, craziest dudes I know.

 Yes, rugby combines hitting with more endurance (clock doesn't stop) than US football. 
 I agree, US football stops a lot.  Methinks TV commercials have a lot to do with this, and a lot to do with why neither soccer nor rugby have caught on here as major spectator sports, even though lots of Americans grow up playing soccer.  For non-Americans, I will point out that the World Cup, which makes us pretend to care about soccer every 4 years, also happens to fall right when the basketball and hockey playoffs have ended, and before the start of US football.  ESPN (sports network) loves this. 
 US football is extremely tactical and that is a large part of its appeal.  It is like chess with titans.  While no where near as much of an endurance sport as rugby, it is incredibly explosive and violent.  Yes, they wear pads, and the style of hitting (not to mention all-out full speed blocking ahead of the ball carrier, which is illegal in rugby) is different from rugby.

 I also said that there could be other more serious problems that a general once over could reveal. Just like someone's cd-rom could be both broken and not have had the drivers installed at the same time.

 There are basic diagnostic practices (with computers, tools like memtest for example) and tools that should be a part of everyone's repertoire.

funny,c4lp7b7,"Sure. Right, so you're used to thinking of bytes as the smallest amount of memory accessible by the computer at once? Now, take that mentality and apply it to pages (which are typically 4kb long). A page is the smallest block of memory an operating system can use, essentially. If a computer wants to move data in massive chunks around, they can't do individual bytes, much like you can't do individual bits without tricky bitwise operations. So, if you want to move memory to disk, you have to do it by the page. 
 Most UNIX-based operating systems (and probably Windows, though I can't say for sure) allocate a page or two for every process created. So, when you start running an application, it has its own page to muck around in. 
 Now, what if, in user-land, you wanted to get the memory address of a certain value? This is encountered all the time in C and C++, with pointers. The only problem is, the page it's in could be anywhere: on disk, in the cache, or anywhere in memory. So, what the operating system does is create a table of pages which can be used to look up where any page is. The pointer you have is actually usually just an offset in the page associated with the application you've written. That has two big implications: 
 
 The page can be anywhere, and the pointer is still valid. 
 
 Because everything is an offset from its own page, it's extremely difficult for one application to overwrite another application's memory, or communicate at all (so the operating system implements other message-passing systems, but that's besides the point.)",The operating system makes you think you're writing to a place you really aren't so it can move around where you're writing.

Pushing something or fighting is about all I can think of, besides kicking your dog or some fucked up shit, and grip becomes extremely important if the fight gets to the ground. In my experience my grip is almost always the weak link when it comes to weight lifting and moving heavy shit in general. I used to use the wrist straps for deadlift and cleans, but it got to the point that I was so reliant on it I couldn't dead lift or clean without them without dropping the weight and potentially hurting myself. Or at the very least look like an asshat in the weight room. Even became a problem during pull-ups unless I did them prior to the heavy lifting crap. I've always had princess fairy forearms that are skinnier than most for some reason, but most my friends feel the same way I do about their grip. So these little gems that I fucking hate because I feel like a puss when I use them because my forearms suck, they're starting to help with aforementioned problem. Sucks ass but they are worth using.","you have to grab shit to do almost anything, the stronger the grip the better."
funny,c2xachi,"Warning! Rant ahead! 
 All these support horror stories are so telling of what a farce customer support has become, and not only with EA. I have had similar experiences with other companies before ( yes , I'm look at you, Logitech). 
 It's as if customer support has become some kind of post-sale sales activity, rather than  actual  customer support. The goal of customer support is no longer to support or help your customer, it's maximizing profit by minimizing effort and liability after the sale has happened by means of incompetent, untrained or understaffed employees. The only reason there is still customer support from companies like EA is because they still feel some kind of shame for the unfinished products they publish. Otherwise, customer support would have been abolished years ago. 
 Personally, I'd rather have the customer support departments be honest about what's going. If they're swamped with requests; fine, but fucking tell me so. You don't know exactly what the problem is? Fine, but fucking tell me so and log the issue for follow up. Yes I'll still be unhappy, but not nearly as pissed-off as having a support request go unanswered for a week, after which you get some bullshit reply from some guy called ""John"" who obviously didn't even bother to read I wrote, pasted some standard reply back and closed the issue without even waiting for a reply. 
 All this shit is why I refuse to work as a support ""engineer"". Don't blame the people that answer your request, they're just doing whatever their boss told them to do. Most will have a conscience and will really try to help you. Others will not, but how does that differ from life in general? Blame the companies that keep supporting this shit, rather than invest in proper staff and infrastructure or just not fucking do it at all.","most customer support infrastructure sucks, and was intentionally designed to do so from the start in order to reduce operating costs."
funny,c4u6ino,"I'm going interrupt this joke with little anatomy lesson. 
 The space between your upper lip and your nose is called your philtrum. Embryologically it is formed by the fusion of the two maxillary processes sweeping in from the sides of your face underneath your nose. When they fail to fuse you have  a cleft lip  to fuse, resulting in a cleft palate. These are some of the most common developmental abnormalities. However, even when a cleft lip is not present, the philtrum can tell you a lot about an embryo's developmental stability. It is very common for developmental problems (such as fetal alcohol syndrome, teratogen exposure, or chromosomal abnormalities) to be accompanied by a shortening of the philtrum. This is why babies with a narrow philtrum receive extra attention by obstetricians who worry that their odd face may predict other developmental problems like heart, GI, and neurological defects.",this joke about an odd face implying mental retardation is surprisingly accurate

funny,c7idu2e,"Alright, as much as I'm down with equality and I really don't think women should bitch about this because it's always smart to look before you sit anywhere, think of the situation this way: 
 As a man, you  have  to look at the toilet to pee, since you will be facing it anyway. If you start peeing without lifting the seat, well you get a little pee on the seat, and wipe it off, no serious issues unless your aim is pretty terrible. To poo, a man must sit down, so this means the toilet seat is down roughly 75% of the time anyway (depending on your daily poo to pee ratio). 
 As a woman, you don't have to look at the toilet necessarily, because you will always be sitting, and always face away. If you don't look and sit down while the seat is up, you will likely fall into the toilet, where you will then have to dry off your parts, get up, put the seat down, and then resume your business as usual. The problems really start when it's an emergency, and if that seat isn't down, you have some serious issues, but hopefully you're quick enough to hold it until you're out of the water.

funny,c21pmem,"Logged in to respond to this oddity of a post. At around the time that mesopotamia and it's stories of Gilgamesh were around, (one of the earliest instances of recorded society) promiscuous women were not looked down upon and instead heralded as bringers of society. (A promiscuous woman brought civility to Enkidu when he was brought out of the wild, as it was stated in the book) There's no reason that the behavioral trend shouldn't be for both men and women to shag, but that society values certain securities and attitudes. Since maternity is usually not in question, the question of paternity has less security. This causes men to want women to be less promiscuous because no one wants to do guesswork, and with men having been extreme misogynists and forcefully in charge (Why did we ever get to the point where we needed women's rights??) women's ability to act on their desires were hampered.
Second, not only is saying that ""religions are made up"" offensive and an example of very poor word choice, but it also does not discount it's ability to influence droves of people. Paul Tillich, a theologian once said that religion was ""the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern."" Of course, it is somewhat easy to see how one can let this idea jump from religion, but the notion of an ultimate concern speaks to the idea that people often feel that there is some thing that grips them completely and that they cannot explain it. Religion is but a way to handle this. Behavioral control and saying that sex is bad is another way to handle this. Women, as a whole are definitely more worried about pregnancy, but that is because most women do not feel ready to be pregnant, and to have to handle a kid. Men don't have to deal with the same pressure and so do not understand the big deal and are more comfortable with having lots of sex.

funny,chmsc34,"To give you the other side of that, my girlfriend is Deaf. I struggle to sign everything that is said and usually can only sign my own sentences (I've only been speaking ASL for 2 years, I'm not there yet). Sometimes I'll turn to speak with someone or whisper a dirty joke and my girlfriend instantly pokes me and asks what we're talking about. 
 There are two big reasons why its frustrating. That she can't let me have a private word with someone or share a joke that would be inappropriate for the setting (swearing with my family, ribbing someone at the table, etc) without instantly poking me and asking what we're talking about. 
 And second that I sometimes just can't figure out how to translate the conversation. I'm barely comfortable calling myself fluent. If I'm driving us home after or trying to keep my ears open to the conversation at the table, I can't always find the right words so it's just easier to say ""nothing"". 
 She also doesn't get the idea of being subtle. If I tell so-and-so that whats-her-face is a drunk/slut/bitch/whatever, and she asks me what I said, ""Oh, nothing"". Never works. I have to then point and sign the offensive thing I just said. 
 Also, sometimes you really were just talking about nothing! If I'm talking to my friends about a video game and she comes up, ""what are you talking about?"". I'll quickly sign the name of the game but I won't bother translating anything else because I know she doesn't care. There is a difference there though, instead of saying ""oh nothing"", I say, ""oh, league"". The only time that gets annoying is when she expects me to stop that conversation immediately and start a new one that includes her. Which is every single time. So....yea.","nothing"" could mean a lot of different things with valid reasons why they don't want to or can't translate for you."

funny,c1pxvx3,"I think you're confusing the symptoms with the disease here. While I'll be the first to say that text messaging as a mode of conversation has limits, it doesn't follow from this that it's an inferior mode of conversation. What happened with David happened because he was insecure and overanxious - a problem he would have run into had he been using any form of communication. 
 You say that if he had been leaving voicemails, there would have been an indicator that his messages were not getting through, but you suggest that text messaging doesn't have this. Ignoring the fact that some text services actually do have multiple indicators for this (one in particular that I've used tells you when it's been sent, when it's been received by the other phone, and when it's been opened by the recipient), there is a social convention that solves this problem: according to this convention, if you've initiated conversation and haven't received a response, there is an extremely finite number of times you can attempt to re-initiate before you are seen as rude. 
 Apart from the poor spelling and bluntness of the first 2-3 messages he sends, there's nothing wrong here; he had some things to say, and he said them in an attempt to begin a conversation. At this point though, a lack of response via text message has the same effect of calling someone three times and not getting an answer. Maybe you might call back in the next day or two, but to continue calling that night is simply rude. In the same way, to continue trying to initiate a conversation when Tara hasn't answered is rude. 
 We all have our personal preferences regarding how we like to communicate - I myself text a lot but aren't particularly fond of it, although I do find it to be more pleasant and effective than phone conversations for the most part. I'm not trying to say that text messaging is superior to anything, or that it doesn't have flaws; rather, I think that for texting, as for all methods of communication, there are areas it excels in, and areas that are best left to other methods. 
 In regards to David's situation, however, I think it is quite clear that the problem is himself, not his chosen method of communication. Perhaps he really is a great guy but he doesn't understand the social rules of text message communication, or something to that effect; even so, the lack is in his understanding, not the method of communication itself.","Texting, like all methods of communication, is limited in some areas, but this situation was clearly David's fault; texting shouldn't be blamed for people's inability to adhere to accepted social norms, nor for their own insecurities."

 I don't drive a honda civic or any tuner most people imagine when they think of a douchey loud car. I have a classic muscle car as my daily driver. When I was little my dad and all of his friends were hot rodders. I would go to car shows every weekend and since I was little I wanted an old, loud, muscle car. So when I had the chance to buy and build this car, I jumped on it. The muscle car sound is as iconic as the Harley's. Its exhaust drone doesn't bother me. The blub blub blub of the engine is actually music to my ears. Those sounds bring me back to when I was little, roaming the car shows in awe of these beautiful pieces of machines. That dose of nostalgia, It's relaxing in a weird way. 
  But, I do understand that other people don't like loud cars. Unfortunately because it is my only car, there are times when I have to drive it late at night. When I do, I try to be courteous to others. I will avoid neighborhoods and residential areas the best I can. If I can't avoid it I will either coast with my engine off or idle through them. Hell. After a party I've even been known to push my car out of my friend's neighborhoods just so I don't wake other people up late at night.

It isn't because I want attention, or just to be a dick, that I drive a loud car. It's because every time I drive it, it brings me joy and reminds me of my childhood. Most people are not like me.

funny,c348jgr,"Nope. Not a separate statement. Definitely not an interjection. 
 To put this in terms relevant to this thread, it's like the first two list items crossed over into an universe where you said ""...there MUST be some usually un-warranted twist in his movies."" 
 In another universe, you just said ""...there MUST be some sudden twist in his movies."" and in yet another, you said ""...there MUST be some violent twist in his movies."" 
 The syntax for integrating each of these parallel universes into one sentence is called parallel structure. 
 The syntax for parallel structure says that you don't put a comma between the last item in a list of adjectives and the object of that list. 
 The reason? Consider  this  Since a list of adjectives provides parallel modifications to the same object, all but one is necessary to preserving the meaning of the sentence. The one  most  important to the meaning of your sentence, by general rhetorical instincts, it the one you put last. 
 You  could  remove all the adjectives, but the purpose of what you're trying to say would be altered, because ""...there MUST be some twist in his movies"" doesn't explain why Shyamalan is more deserving of being the namesake of a meme about twists than any other director who uses unexpected endings (see: the vast majority of thriller writers and directors). 
 The reason we don't say ""Directed by Christopher Nolan"" or ""Directed by Alfred Hitchcock"" is because Shyamalan's twists are trite and worthy of parody. Hence, ""un-warranted"" is essential. Hence, it should not be sequestered from the rest of the sentence by commas.","A last resort for deciding whether or not a comma belongs is to read the sentence as you might speak it, putting small pauses wherever you see a comma.

 This covers all the employees, uniforms (which are provided by the franchise for all in stadium employees), some insurance is taken out of our pay but it may not be all of it, I don't know. All of the electrical, and maintenance is paid for by the team, my company does nothing about that, those expenses are taken out of the 48.5%. 
 We have a 5% assumed spoilage each night (for returns, or the hot dogs we have left over at the end of the night), more than that and we get our pay docked. So I hate to tell you but if you've ever eaten at the stadium you've probably had a hot dog that was dropped on the ground because we can't afford the extra spoilage and if it happens too much we can lose our jobs. 
 This leaves 24.5% of sales as the ""profit"" of the stand (there are still our supervisors who have to be paid, they are the only employees not already accounted for). 
 I'll assume we get the cups for 15 cents each, so that brings the total cost of the soda you're drinking to 20 cents (cup + 2 times filling a 32 oz drink). So, subtract the 75.5% expenses and you're left with $1.8985, which I'll round to $1.90. Subtract the 20 cents of material cost and the company is left with $1.70 per drink sold.

funny,ca3iuwe,"I read through all the replies and didn't exactly see the correct answer, so here goes.. 
 It's not about Mormon's watching the most porn, even though Utah does indeed have one of the highest search histories in the country. What Mormon culture does undeniably have is a huge history of performance and entertainment. I moved to Utah 5 or so years ago due to my family's work in the film industry. Since then I've worked on 5 or so films while attending classes at The U. Every one of them had at least a small amount of dancing or singing, and a few of them were fairly provocative numbers. 
 Mormons are also known for their modesty. Those who are more heavily devout have to have sleeves on all of their outfits (ie no spaghetti straps, tank tops, etc.). However, a very high majority of our dancers were born and raised, Utah-strength mormons. When it came to getting in front of the camera though, conditions that would normally be taboo became totally fine, because after all, it isn't real. 
 Part of it is admirable to cast away personal morals to get the best product, but it's also a little weird. I'm fairly convinced this is what the Family Guy bit was about, because when the cop turns towards the camera, he says,  ""Remember kids, she's not a whore, IF she's in front of a camera.""  The pornography part is just taking it to a ridiculous extreme, but the point being made is that in the eyes of The Mormon Church, certain morally compromising situations are overlooked if it's for the sake of dance, film, or art.","There are a lot of mormons in showbiz, and they're willing to put forth the same work as any other actor or actress, regardless of what their personal beliefs might be.

funny,cf7quyu,"Sure! The [scientific method]( actually tries to do it's best to remove all faith or belief that your answer is correct or incorrect. It is a way to gather new information and correct old information. Here's how it works: 
 1. Define a question. 
 Does the Earth have an attractive force that causes things to move toward it? 
 2. Gather information and resources (observe) 
 In order to find out more I'll look up other research on the topic of the Earth and attractive forces. This will allow me to see what other people have written and experimented with on the topic. To my surprise I find out that there's this thing called gravity and more specifically topics on the [gravity of earth]( However, I don't know if I really believe that their experiments are correct. So I continue with my scientific inquiry. 
 3. Form an explanatory hypothesis 
 Given the information that I've gathered I'm going to form a  disprovable  hypothesis. So instead of asking if the Earth has an attractive force, I'm going to state, ""Things that are dropped on Earth will always fall to the ground."" The hypothesis isn't a questions but rather a statement that can either be true or not true  and  it's truth can be tested. 
 4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner 
 In order to test my hypothesis I'm going to hold this pencil over the floor and see if it's attracted to the Earth (ie see if it falls on the ground). I'm going to record my results as I find them and possibly perform this test several times. Lo and behold every time I let go of this pencil it falls to the ground. 
 5. Analyze the data 
 Well I have very solid data for my experiment. I've dropped the pencil multiple times and every single time it fell to the ground. I possibly will use this step to graph this data so it can be interpreted easier. 
 6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis 
 Every time I dropped the pencil it fell. That seems to reinforce my hypothesis that, ""Things dropped on Earth will always fall to the ground."" However I don't know what's causing them to drop exactly but I do know that they do in fact fall to the ground. This would probably give me a good starting point for another question, ""Is there an attractive force between large bodies of mass?"" and form another hypothesis, ""There is an attractive force between bodies that grows stronger with the mass of that object."" 
 7. Publish results 
 Well since I've done my experiment and analyzed my results I can go and publish them. With this experiment as soon as I hit the save button they will be published however, it's not usually that easy in the real world. 
 8. Retest (frequently done by other scientists) 
 By publishing my results it will allow other people to conduct similar experiments, and see if my findings were sound. I encourage you to drop a pencil to the floor and see what happens. If it does in fact fall upward then perhaps I'm wrong and we need to re-evaluate my hypothesis. 
 Removing any faith in your answer is the crux of the scientific method because you're hypothesis  has to able to be proven incorrect.  That's not to say that it  can  be proven incorrect, but merely that you need to have some path in which it can be proven incorrect. It's also important to note that the scientific method is a cycle. Once you're done you start over with new information. The same question should be retested multiple times and new questions should arise from your past experiments. You also have to be able to reproduce your results over and over and over and over into infinity in order for it to be considered accepted in science. 
 The difference between the scientific method and the question of religion is that you can't actually test the statement, ""There is a God."" while you can test the statement, ""Organisms evolve to form other organisms."" It goes against the crux of a hypothesis in that you cannot disprove it. With all scientific research I can take their publication and test their results. I am given detailed information on how they arrived at their result and I am allowed to challenge it using the same methods that they used. I do not have to take their findings on faith but rather I can reproduce their experiment and find my own results.",Gravity still works and I never have to take that statement on faith alone.

 FWIW I was like you for a long time - I thought plastic surgery was making yourself ""fake"", people should just accept who they are, etc.  And I still believe the latter is preferable. 
 But fact is, we're a completely different person every 7 years or so mentally anyway.  We have a finite time on this earth to find happiness.  And some people will not, ever, be happy as they are due to ""ugliness."" 
 Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder - but ""objective ugliness"" exists and finding the few people that think differently can be far  more  difficult than surgery.  Not to mention you still have to deal with the 99.9% of people that judge you, even subconsciously, for your appearance. 
 There was a fascinating study I read once as to which ""disability"" impacted work/success/relationships/happiness/etc. the most, and it wasn't being fat, having a tic, or even missing limbs - it was ugliness.  The ""reddit rule for dating"" (""1. Be attractive, 2. Don't be unattractive"") isn't really a joke - people can and will treat you differently every day based on how you look. 
 Now as I said - if you are a person who can come to terms with that and accept and love yourself for who you are, I think you don't need surgery.  But there are millions of people who can't do that, for whatever reason, and I will never blame them for making the other choice. 
 I've come to accept plastic surgery as a part of society I support.  If I could get gene therapy to give me wings or a better sense of smell or something, would I?  Heck yeah.  Well that's the next step.","When people ask me for advice on whether to get surgery, I only specify two things: 
 1) Do it for you, not anyone else.  Even if it's because of society, do it because it will make  you  happier, because you want to see something different and satisfying in the mirror.  I've met too many women who got boob jobs or lipo because their husband told them to. 
 2) Do it right.  Pay the big bucks.  Don't go cheap on your own body, because you will pay for it in one, five, ten years.  Maybe with your life."

funny,ceauy5o,"Hey there. 
 For most people, air injected through an IV is not a big deal. The air usually dissipates quite quickly, if any makes it to the heart (the ultimate point for all veins) they are pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. The air is gradually resorbed. There have been studies in dogs that have reported the amount of air required to cause problems, I don't remember the exact amount but I think it's somewhere around 1 cc per kilogram. So quite a bit of air! The standard syringe you see in hospitals/hospital dramatizations is 10 cc. 
 The thing is, these studies and this information relies on a crucial detail - that the heart has a completely formed atrial septum. There is a wall of tissue that separates the right heart (pumping blood from veins to the lungs) from the left heart (pumping blood from the lungs to the arteries and thus to organs and the brain). 
 In some people, this wall (septum in medical terms) in completely forms. This is termed a septal defect, which can be without symptoms if it occurs in the atrial septum (the 'top' of the heart). An atrial septal defect (ASD) allows blood, and air if present, to cross from the right heart to left heart. If a significant amount of air enters the arterial circulation, this can lead to significant problems. If the air travels to the brain, the air can collect in the small arteries and prevent oxygenation of brain tissue, effectively causing a stroke. Air in arteries (arterial air embolism) can often occur during some medical procedures which involves cannulation of arteries.",Air in a vein is not a significant problem unless a large amount of air is injected or if the air crosses into the arterial system via a fistula or heart defect.

 But it wasn't.  Every day she was picked on.  Most of the time the instigator was Rachel, who called her ""fat fuck"" or ""Shamu"" or ""Ballast"" (a play on ""Alice"").  Every night Alice would go home crying.  Her parents would tell her that life gets better, but Alice knew that it didn't make life any better now.

funny,ck54kj1,"You say it is weird but you obviously don't know anything about homeschooling. 
 I was homeschooled until I was 14, and as of now I'm in advanced placement classes in the best private school. I'm now 17 and my grades are currently wavering around 90-95 percent. I'm not socially stunted in  any  way, I have many friends too. Also, I wasn't living in North America. Wrong assumption there. 
 I think that homeschooling is often far better than normal schooling, so long as the parent  teaches  and teaches at the child's pace. 
 For academics, I was ahead of the normal curriculum by around a grade or more. For english, I was reading the classics (the works of Charles Dickins, Animal Farm, 1984, The Great Gatsby, and American lit) by 10 years old, so I was incredibly advanced in my writing skills. My science skills were subpar in comparison, around the same grade level as normal kids, but I  loved  (and still love) physics and concepts that concerned space. At 14, I was learning calculus, just devouring textbooks of math one at a time. World History interested me too, so i'd read a lot of history textbooks for fun. 
 When I transitioned to a ""normal"" private school, I was placed in all the advanced classes. I could've skipped a grade but my French was an issue, considering I'd just moved to Quebec. 
 Still though, it was a bit hard to adjust to how easy the classes were in comparison, and how I had to learn how to fistbump instead of handshake. It wasn't too much of an issue though. 
 However.... 
 If you compare my homeschooling to the homeschooling of my Uncle's grandsons... 
 Hoo boy. They were homeschooling for all the wrong reasons. First, they were religious nuts. Second, they had two kids who were in different grades. That's tough to teach. What's more, the nutty mother said that ""she finishes with them by lunchtime"". Two different grades to teach... By lunchtime? What the hell. We'd wake up at around 10 and work until dinnertime.

It was as if his mother hadn't given him proper social interaction, leaving him with only his younger sister to develop his speech. Worse, he could barely add or subtract in Monopoly, even when it was as simple as counting out $120. He read the ""community chest"" cards  really  slowly. He could barely read, and I was reading 200 page books at that age.

I used to work in construction and we would tease each other about almost anything, almost nothing was off limits and everything was definitely not PC.  I agree with your overall point though, when it comes to work it's playground politics.  One of the reasons I left construction project management is that it's very hard to be a 'nice' boss  and to get anything done.  If there's no perceived physical threat from you, your subordinates will not respect you regardless of your job title and position within the company.  I bulked up and developed a 'mean' side just to get the job done, ie: I would crowd the worker's personal space when I would talk to him, I cursed more (although I did this casually and jokingly rather; I never berated anyone), I would laugh out loud while a someone was angry or annoyed, etc..  Thank god I left for a manufacturing environment, it's like night and day.  I can be myself, just friendly and soft-spoken, I can ask subordinates to do something (to allow them to have some dignity) and they will get it done, and I feel more like a leader than a boss.","Don't go into construction project management, unless you've experienced the environment before.

funny,c0t4dkw,"At my school, they weren't hated.  We had a very large Indian student body, and they were given whatever they wanted basically. 
 I for a lot time took no issue with them, and welcomed them, until I got to know them.  I joined the biotech club, and was voted in against the will of the founding members as VP.  The biotech program is about 85% Indian, and they all keep to themselves (I was the only white officer).  They only work under the Indian professors, and don't like talking to other students.  They all live together, and are all part of another on campus club, the Indian Student Union (ISU). 
 ISU would throw a Diwali festival every year, and they would of course come to the people in charge of dispersing funds and ask for money for it... only every year, they asked for WAY more then they needed, and never gave it back. 
 They also did this for their cricket tournaments and several other events they hosted. 
 They never did any fundraising, but everyone on the council that voted to give out the funds didn't want to seem disrespectful at to the international students at all.  So they would just all agree to give them the money every year, and wouldn't complain when they didn't give back the overage. 
 However, when my other club asked for money to go to an annual conference/research competition (which we ALWAYS won, and always paid the money back once we fund raised enough) we would get grilled about ever single cent!!

funny,crhobil,"I understand why this bothers a lot of people, but I also think it makes perfect sense. Free speech, first of all, has never applied to contracts between individuals. It's intended to preserve the right to criticise government. It certainly does not mean people are free from criticism and consequences from others (including individuals and businesses). 
 Reddit is a business and their product is their userbase. It makes sense for them to preserve that userbase and cater to the majority, who are not the sort of people who wander over to FatPeopleHate or KotakuInAction or Spacedicks (is that still a thing?). The majority of people just want a fun, light distraction with maybe a few intellectual blips to pass the time. It makes sense to be politically correct and to maintain a point-of-view and a perspective. All good businesses are true to their brand and that brand generally doesn't change to suit the people who already know it, but the people who don't yet. 
 As of late, Reddit has been getting a bit much to browse at certain times -- and this is from somebody who used to be a Goon and witnessed the proliferation of the pain series and swap.avi. There are subreddits that are regularly plastered all over /r/all that are incredibly alienating, though not indicative of the attitudes of Reddit as a whole and seem to cater to the lowest common denominators. 
 It only makes sense that the company would want to limit this effect and maybe toss out the people who don't project the image that they've created. So, I can understand why she'd want to be up front about her stance on what she believes this site to be about, and I honestly don't think it's a bad thing. I really do believe that it would be better for the site as a whole if it were moderated with an eye towards people's feelings. 
 Obviously there's a line in there somewhere between moderation and censorship and that's tough to define, but right now, I think the content is starting to suffer for all the political warfare going on between keyboard warriors. I'm not even going to bother with classifying them because I know half of what's said on here on either side would never be uttered out loud, even in the most trusted company. That kind of blatant sexism and racism is just not okay and does need to be culled. 
 I for one do not think subs that are based on hating one group of people to the point of being mean should exist on Reddit. I don't think people should be free from having their posts removed when they goad people who post on mental health subs. I think we all have the right to enjoy our time on this website and more and more people seem to enjoy ruining that experience for others of some vague idea of what some other website thinks about life. It's frustrating and definitely needs to be dealt with. 
 Anyway, at the end of the day, it's not OUR website. We just post here. We rent space by looking at ads and I think a lot of people have forgotten that. Reddit could shut down tomorrow and nobody could say boo because it's not like there's some god-given right to post on Reddit.","If you don't want to have your post censored, either don't be an insufferable cunt, or make your own website with hookers, and blackjack."

These projectors have to be at a certain point in the ceiling as to be not too big for the screen and not too small as to not fill it out completely (they get pissed when it doesn't fill up the entire screen especially a smartboard, which is understandale). Now you may tell yourself ""but the image size can be adjusted to fit the screen"" and to an extent you would be right. BUT you cannot just put it anywhere and expect to be able to adjust it for the screen size you want. Sure you can go into the settings and adjust the image size but is very very very limited. You can't just stick the projector 3 ft away from the screen, on the ceiling, and expect to be able to blow the image up to fit a 100 inch screen or what have you, unless you have what is known as a ""short throw"" projector which costs a fair amount more than your standard projector.

 Yeah, because if you're going to say something is fact, you should really have data to back it up.  Also I wanted you to waste some of your time looking for articles to support your statement.  And hey look!  You found some.  Let's go through them: 
 
 A 1989 study of 318 college students that find obese people and red-haired men unattractive.  [Guess that's why it's also okay to bully red-haired people?] 
 A 1993 study that finds normal-weight women with well-distributed body fat are most attractive, but does not state anything about the obese being specifically  un attractive (""less attractive"" is not equivalent to ""unattractive"") 
 Is the same study as #2 
 Is a study on attraction within certain cultures.  It comes to the same conclusion as the study in #2/3 (i.e. not that fat is unattractive, but that normal weight is attractive.) 
 Was a study done on 42 couples and your","is bullshit: ""These data confirm that assortative mating for obesity exists when dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is used to evaluate adiposity. We hypothesize that assortative mating may have contributed to the obesity epidemic because the time course of obesity development has shifted progressively earlier, allowing singles in their late teens and early twenties to more easily distinguish partners with obese and lean phenotypes."" 
 Is the same study as #2/3.

funny,c23bh8w,"Sorry. I am native English speaker. It's just my head has been all over the place today and it's been difficult for me to stay on track. 
 I'm not saying that we didn't know that sex makes babies and so abortion was legalized. I'm just saying that all that was known was that somewhere between sex and birth, a human is made, and due to the indescrepancy, we have labeled the unborn child as a potential life all throughout pregnancy, and not an actual life. 
 Assuming that a fetus is potential life, then I have no argument here. It'd be obvious that the life of the mother, a human being, outweighs potential life, and that with the potential life being inside of her, she'd have the final say on whether it lives or dies. Now I could go on to say how the number one reason why women get an abortion because the man in their life forces or coerces her to. I could go on about the regret that I've heard from many women who I've seen in tears from having one. I could rant all day about these things, and they would be good reasons not to have an abortion, but the would not good reasons to make an abortion illegal. 
 But now we know more about prenatal development, like different stages, and what happens at each one. The pro-life argument is that a human life begins at conception; the point where our genome is created. The point from which we all develop. The point where our height, eye color, facial structure, etc are determined. 
 There are actually only four differences between the embryo you once were and who you are today: size, level of development, environment, and degree of dependency. None of these has before separated human from non human, and so it must be true that a cell that is different from any other in the universe must be protected as a human.","what is it that separates who we are today from who we were at conception, and how is that enough to distinguish a valuable human life we should protect and trash?

funny,c4ww0sj,"Story time.  I was once at a church lock in (kind of like slumber party but not at someone's house) when I was 13 years old, just starting puberty.  This was literally a week after attending something call ""True Love Waits"" where we learn the various benefits about waiting until marriage and at the end of the seminar we all signed a little contract with god promising we'd wait until marriage.  Well about a week later, I'm sleeping on the floor in one of the church classrooms and I'm woken up by the sound of people stepping around in the dark. 
 I wake up and find that a handful of the girls had woken up and entered the boy's room, and one or two of the younger 10 or 11 year old boys had woken up as well.  I wake up and join them for their adventures. 
 We sneek off into another dark room and sit around chatting.  This one girl, about my age, well known for being the ""made up"" one who liked to wear revealing clothes at 13 years old offered to give me a BJ.  I was dumbfounded.

 So I decline.  The next day we go to the amusement park.  I'm second guessing this BJ thing and thinking of a way we can sneek off onto the love boat so I can get my first BJ ever.

funny,c0w7zww,"When I was visiting Israel last winter I was at one point staying in some Bedouin tents in the middle of the Negev desert, although this particular ""tent"" was clearly made for tourists.  As inauthentic as the place felt, it did have very authentic camels, and while the rest of the group I was with were all socializing with each other a couple hundred feet from me, I was much more interested in watching how the camels behaved toward each other in their very large pen at night. 
 If anybody had randomly come up to the pen and watched the camels for only a minute or so, they would have seen a couple camels standing, a couple camels ""sitting"" on the ground, and a bunch of camels feeding.  However, over the course of the two hours or so that I spent watching them (I guess I was in a very anti-social mood), I got more than just a glimpse of them, and actually started to notice behavioral trends. 
 These particular camels had to either reach their necks over or under a fence to get at the hay on the other side.  Because this was a straight fence, it meant that they all had to stand next to each other, rib cage to rib cage.  Since there were fewer spots available than there were camels, whenever a camel was feeling peckish, it would go over to the line of camels and lightly nip a feeding camel just above the tail with its mouth.  Almost immediately, this camel would stop eating and give up its spot to the camel who wanted it. 
 The camel would back out and the hungry one would take its spot, as if it was a parking lot and there was only a limited amount of spaces for cars.  There was no pushing, shoving, or quarreling amongst the camels.  A hungry one would simply tag out one that was feeding and take his or her place.  He or she wouldn't try to squeeze in, and the tagged camel wouldn't move over--it would actually back out of its space and leave the feeding area because it seemed as though they had all previously agreed that there were a certain amount of spots available to them, and pushing and shoving wasn't allowed. 
 No camel would ever try to push or wedge their way through to the food except for the two male camels that I eventually realized may have been vying for dominance.  If these guys were asked to vacate their spot, sometimes they would, but sometimes they'd turn their heads, grunt loudly, and continue feeding.  Each other camel 
 There was definitely a hierarchy and a set of rules to be followed amongst these bizarre creatures but I really had to stand there a while to see them in action.  It was like watching sea urchins--you don't notice them move, but over a long period of time you notice that movement has occurred.  If you were to speed up this 2 hour period I spent watching these camels, you'd see a large group of camels interacting with each other in their own society.  I thought it was cool. 
 So that's the end of my anecdote.  Derp.",I watched a bunch of camels interact with each other for a couple hours and it was pretty interesting.

funny,c8o08us,"I'll explain a little about my experience with it and it may make a little sense. 
 Our company has always had a laid back environment. When I was initially hired, I was hired as an IT tech. We fielded support calls to fix people's internet issues, email issues, dialup/isdn, etc. Over the next year I was promoted a few times. With the final promotion came the requirement that I reprimand individuals for not doing their job when it occurred. This position then evolved into basically being ""the enforcer"" for the management of the company. 
 I neither tried to create fear in the techs nor did I have a greed for power. I am one of the last few people who were raised with the old-time mentality of company loyalty and I took my job seriously. I did this job for about a year and I was very good at it. Too good at it. I wasn't mean. I didn't instill fear through intimidation tactics or bullying. People shut up when I walked by simply because they knew that if I was there to talk to someone it was because they were in trouble of some sort. During this time I was going through a divorce from a woman who was very negative our whole marriage (not an exaggeration, just pointing it out) and she had turned me into a bitter person. Bitter meaning I just didn't put up with people's bullshit. 
 After a year, being the ""enforcer"" really took a toll on me. I hated that people didn't like me even though I was friendly 95% of the time to everyone. It was the 5% of the time that I had to ""get down to brass tax"" with someone that had created this image of the hulking giant that everyone saw me as. 
 Even years after I stopped doing the job (I finally said I'd had enough of being the company bully, so to speak) and being promoted into another role that allowed me to manage instead of ""picking on people"" the stories and ""myths"" existed... Suddenly, two or three generations of employees had come through the company and every one of them knew of the stories. Not a single one of them had been there for the year that it occurred, yet everyone held it against me. (Think of the monkeys and the ladder. If you don't know about that story look it up. It puts it into perspective) 
 All of the people I work with now know these stories, but also know the reality of it all. They all have been here for so long that they know the truth and the ""myth"" no longer haunts me as an employee, a manager or a vice president... Although one good thing came out of it: Respect. They know that I care that they are doing the best they can. They know that I care that they take care of our clients and their customers. They know that if I come talk to them that it's not because I hate them or I want them to leave but because I want them to better themselves in one way or another or improve their performance. They know that this company is important to me, and that they are important to me both as a manager/employee and as a human being. 
 If you have made it this far, I commend you. Thank you for taking the time to read it. If you haven't, I'll give you a","Summary: Sometimes the ""bad"" managers aren't bad after all (as you pointed out, it's subjective) and are just misunderstood.

funny,c9otvq4,"A few stories about these guys: 
 When I was about 10 years old, I went to bed as I did every night before school. I awoke one morning about 2-3am to a tickle/itch on my leg. I half asleep thought nothing of it and went to scratch it.. The itch bit me!! I hopped the fuck out of bed and went running to parents about the itch that bit me. They went and pulled up the sheets, and there was one of those guys chillin on the bed. 
 Story no two was a few years ago. 
 We had one of these dudes chilling in the lunges room/welcome area for a few weeks in places moderately hard to catch, pretty harmless so we let him do his thing, I came home from a party one morning and he was chillin on the carpet at the entrance of my room. I wanted him further then 2m away from my sleeping head by the time I went to bed, so I prodded him a bit to leave my room. Instead he went running in further and on top of a few plastic bags right next to the pillow. I was ""Nope. You're a chill spider-bro and all, but after my 10 year old experience, you're crampin' my style a bit"" 
 I prodded him a bit further, and he ended up back at the entrance, he stood facing me with his two front legs up in the air. I went to prod him one more time thinking he will run outside the room, nope. He charged me. I freaked out like a little girl and jumped on the bed, he tried to charge me again but instead I tried to prod him to back away, he went running up the side of my server cabinet and was jumping between the cabinet and the wall until he had a good vantage point to watch me. He followed my moves carefully, waiting for me to come into striking distance. I got the fuck out the room and went and grabbed the insecticide. 
 I sprayed him, and at first nothing, but then I noticed him get dizzy and lose balance as he tried to make sense of the neurotoxic chemical flowing through him. He tried to run away from its effects, but found himself sliding down the side of the railing of the cabinet. Over he next 10-15 minutes he struggled to keep himself stationary and eventually wound up on the ground. I squished him at this point as I couldn't watch his pain anymore. I'm sorry I had to murder you spider-bro, but violence got the better of us both. 
 Story no three was only a few months back. 
 I was coming home from collecting something from the servo. Its dark but still fairly early, we hop out of the car, and as I walk under the branch to the stairs to the house I feel something fall onto me. I thought it was a twig or leaf or something, as I was carrying a couple of bags so I didn't bother to check. But after I get inside and put down the bags, I feel a tickle on my head and brush it off. Off falls a spider-bro taking a ride on me inside to warmth. I went and grabbed a tub, caught him and put him outside. About an hour later I spot a much smaller spider-bro inside (about half the size of an adult huntsman). I catch him and put him outside too. 
 I figure it's just the mother spider-bro finding its lost and stranded kid. I wasn't mad at either. 
 My final story is a short one.

funny,cha9ppd,"Older Macintosh computers, before the company became branded as Apple, had a key on the keyboard similar to the Windows key. 
 [Example]( 
 The key had an apple with a bite taken out of it which was Macintosh's logo at the time.  Later, the command key was added due to Steve Jobs feeling that the apple appearing in all of the drop-down menus was an overuse of the logo.  Many people have posted here that it is in fact the Swedish campground symbol; and, in at least one case, a cloverleaf symbol.  Either way, it is labeled as the command key since it is used to give short commands to the computer. 
 Overtime though, most likely to further distance themselves from Microsoft, Macintosh chose to drop the 'open apple' key from a majority of their keyboards.  You can still purchase Apple keyboards with the open apple key though though the actual 'open apple' function of it no longer does anything. 
 Like highlanders, 'open apple' and 'command' fought.  Command finished the job his predecessors started and took the head of 'open apple'.

It would be one thing if this was a rare occurrence, but people love to do shit like this in bookstores and when you have to fix it all the time it gets really tiresome. As noted above, bibles in the fiction section are a common occurrence. We're talking daily. 
 It's enough work cleaning up after ""customers"" who treat a bookstore like a library. I never had any problem with someone who came in to read a book without paying for it but the people who do usually sit there for six hours, taking up space other people could use if they want to browse or need a rest... and those people usually grab a fucking stack of books (graphic novels especially) and leave them there for you to put away when they leave. 
 Even worse is the people who start reading a book, then hide it somewhere sonobody else can find and buy it, so that they can read it again the next day. In a grocery store it's a pain when you find an item that is out of place, but at least it's super easy to go put it away. This is WAY more common in a bookstore and the thing is you're dealing with literally millions of different products with different ISBN numbers.

I regularly had to tell people they couldn't sit on the floor because yes, this is in fact a store.

 The problem with your analogy is that while I too have a natural fear of a bear as a potential predator, the fear is not sufficient to stop me from going camping because I know that: 
 A) As long as I follow some simple campsite precautions (do not keep food near the tent, suspend any food that is not tightly sealed a bit away from the campsite, I can minimize the risk of a bear being attracted to my site. 
 B) I keep up to date about bear sitings I know where there is a high risk of encountering one. 
 C) If I am aware of how to respond to a potential bear encounter, I can minimize my chance of being attacked. 
 When all the proper precautions are followed, the chance of being fatally attacked by a bear is extremely low. They do not hunt humans and are generally afraid of them.

 Whoever I was replying to specified that whats-his-name is a fat Canadian fuck. I don't disagree; he's a fat fuck, and he's Canadian (as far as I know; I give too few fucks to confirm it). As a Canadian, I don't particularly wish to be associated with fat fucks, so my second comment served to illustrate him as an outlier, not representative of the Canadian philosophy. Whatever the Canadian philosophy might be (you decide; I don't care), I'd rather he not exemplify it. As far as I can tell, I did this in a lighthearted, polite manner that shouldn't seriously offend anyone who isn't an uptight prudish prick.

However, instead of forming any sort of rational response to educate me as to why you were offended, you decided I wasn't fit to inhabit the same country as your saintly self and requested most forcefully that I leave. 
 Honestly, I was quite taken aback by your instant hostility. However, the irony of how far you deviated from the Canadian stereotype while basically saying you're more Canadian than me was too funny to pass up and I had to point it out. Not that I believe in or support the Canadian stereotype, but I mean, come on. It was pure gold (to my ever-more-evidently unique sense of humor). Oh, and you weren't supposed to find that funny. I was making fun of you. That part was supposed to be offensive. But again, you didn't get it. You just kept going. You still thought I was serious. I dunno if you just love whales that much or if you're more nationalistic than I am, but you seem determined to piss me off.

worldnews,c1omxlj,"From what others have pointed out below (citations from other Redditors all below): this data shows measurements of an instrument inside the Dry Well of the reactor (which is the big concrete container surrounding the reactor) measuring Svt/Hr (amount of radiation, 1 svt/hr could kill you after an hour, 100 svt/hr would fry you in seconds). However the Tokyo Electric Power Company has been reported that the meter was likely broken. No one knows if this is true because you can't get close enough to see it without receiving a lethal dose and no one wants to pull a Spock. Some speculate that the core has melted. On April 4th nuclear experts started to speculate that we will see a recriticality in which the reactors will increase the pace of chain reactions rather than slow down.
My opinion: If you look at the other measurements, they are constant. No temperature increase or pressure increase. During the reaction you basically have a Plutonium atom being hit by a neutron and this turns into fragments, more neutrons and energy. If you saw a huge spike like this, it would be akin to ""Supercriticality,"" like a nuclear bomb. That energy can't turn into purely ionizing radiation it will also turn into heat, light, etc. So since our other meters are holding constant, that is not happening. The ""we don't know for sure"" is coming from people trying to cover their ass in case something is misinterpreted later and they lose their job.
The tools used to measure radiation seem to be made out of tubes full of gases (although I don't know what an industrial instrument looks like). But I'm assuming the earthquake or something cracked the tubes, the gas slipped out and the meter defaulted at 100.","No one can see what's going on, but there was no mushroom cloud so I'm assuming the meter broke."

 All citizens of Israel have the same rights, and being a Jewish state doesn't preclude that, Israel was largely founded with the idea of being a Jewish homeland and creating a law of return for all Jewish people around the world. By being a Jewish state they can offer a right to Jews they don't offer to everyone (the law of return) keeping a largely educated and Jewish populace, Abbas wants the law of return to apply to all palestinians and descendants of palestinians, which would quick turn Israel into an Arab state with a small Jewish minority. 
 The idea of having a Jewish state, is so Jews have a place to escape to in case the countries they are living in becomes inhospitable often due to pan-arabism and Islamic extremism (e.g. France, much of the Arab world in the early 50s) if Israel ceases to be a Jewish state it will lose much of its legitimacy in its own creation and reason for its existence. While Israel does accept refugees from all over the world, a larger percentage of them are Jewish. 
 While there were only around 1.7 million Palestinians in 1948 there are now almost 12 million which is around the same as the world Jewish population of 13 million. Since both countries want a law of return for their own people it only makes sense you would call one a Palestinian state and another a Jewish state.

worldnews,c6kud8w,"Um i know this isn't the place to say but.... Yeah i climbed past 7th station a couple of years ago dunno if i made it to 8th but here is why, 
 I was taking out a rented phone every station taking beautiful video and photos, when i reached the 7th i reached into my pocket and the phone was gone, i kept on walking a bit but started to get angry and grumpy because on this phone was Vlogs of my entire trip, things i saw that were amazing/odd from the train that passes through a mountain to come out in the most gorgeous waterfall i had ever seen to the Night a Maiko came to a Kyoto teahouse and pulled funny faces to make us laugh when we all ran out of conversational Japanese. 
 or just downright creepy, like a night me and a friend stayed out all night in Kubikicho in bars/clubs until the trains were running again which is story for another time o_o. 
 There was pictures of me and my traveling companions.. of the weird and wonderful japan has to offer almost a month of observations and thoughts, of quiet moments people watching, Bands that played, bars we invaded, fun we had. The whole shebang gone. 
 SO i turned around and walked back down to the second 5th station the one with larger shop and space and more people milling about before their climb or whatever. 
 Watching every step i took down for this small Black LG phone i had rented drilling the sentences in Japanese i would need to ask when i got to the store keepers 
 where are the payphones? 
 Kōshūdenwa wa dokodesu ka? 
 Have you found a lost Cellphone?
Anata wa ushinawa reta geitaidenwa o mitsuketa nodesu ka? 
 (Google translating the above, my Japanese was worse than a machine translation so you'll get how garbled i asked these things :() 
 Sadly nobody had found the phone, I tried calling the mobile and it rang so it was still alive somewhere i urgently left a voice mail message in English and realizing the futility rang a friend to leave a message in japanese, Sadly they didnt get the message untill much to late. Fairly dejected i begun my climb back up from 5th station eying every black rock for phone shape proportions but the rain came. 
 It started to rain so hard i couldn't see shit but it obviously was pushing people back down the mountain there was more people walking down in fact i think only about a dozen people were going up (They passed me as speed literally jogging up Fuji...i wish i had my phone for that), it was the last day before close of season and we were to be staying in one of the huts up by 7th station. by this point all my companions were almost up Fuji-san and i started my slog back to the hut. weather got worse i got very tired i don't remember the climb back up so well i was kinda destroyed. there's a saying 
 ""A wise man climbs Fuji-san once in his life; only a fool climbs it twice"" 
 Well i'm a full blown idiot as i had decided to climb a part of it twice in 1 day. 
 I reached the hut and sat outside, i don't know why, i was wrapped up in a rain protector but by now it was soaked on the inside with sweat and the heavy torrent of rain i sat there clinging to my climbing stick and thanks to the keepers in the hut, slipped on shoes and braved the weather convincing me to come inside and sat me down in front of the stove to warm up, i had gotten so wet the day bag of clothes i had with me were useless and soaked as well so i sat there shivering trying to get warm in wet clothes, i inhaled a bowl or 2 of curried rice and clambered into a bunk semi clad and wrapped up in a blanket, my friends arrived a few hours later they had managed to avoid alot of the rainfall in comparison getting so high up but were also soaked and everyone settled down for the night,
(Which included emptying the fridge of beer they had stocked) 
 The night got hellishly stormy in a bit of a stupor with the drink the altitude and the weather beating i was nightmaring in my bunk about getting left behind. 
 Which wasn't a problem as next morning it started to look like we were going nowhere 
 the climb down the next day was terrible visibility was nonexistent and as a fairly big guy i was able to lean into the wind and be held up by it. 
 we made it down safely but were pretty much destroyed clothes wise we all pretty much stripped outside of our bus at the 5th station and rode back to the city exhausted.

 The USA  started  the wars in Afganistan and Iraq - with stated (initial) goals of destroying Al Qaeda and killing Osama Bin Laden, and preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction against the US (the latter of course being a quickly discarded facade to win over the public and international community at large). More importantly, it is completely factual to say the USA has a recent history of destabling governments it doesn't like, as well as instigating and declaring wars, possibly only towards its own selfish gains (debatable). 
 This isn't even getting in to the massive social ills that urk America as an industrial prison complex, with more of their own citizens deprived of freedom than any other country in the world, both by population and per capita. I would argue that the American government is at war with their own people, but we don't even have to count that if you'd rather. 
 Comparing a country with a volunteer mission to help in a war torn nation, against the country that started the war there and with a known modus operandi of starting wars of aggression with other nations (both through proxies and more recently by direct assault) is absurd.

The Revolutionaries wouldn't have stood a chance against the full might of the British army, and fortunately they never had to.

worldnews,cc64sp7,"Wow, that article was terrible. 
 1) This is hardly a German specific thing. The same happens in other countries, with Energy costs reducing to literally 0, or going negative. This can be the case whether you draw you energy from renewables, nuclear, coal or whatever. Due to the way energy flows, you can observe what is known as the Spring Washer effect, where pricing for certain customers will go negative, purely based off distribution effects, not generation effects. You can also have low or no pricing due to consumption effects. 
 For a nice explanation of the Spring Washer effect from a bloke with a great Kiwi accent, I highly recommend 
 2) They can't decide what point they are making at any one time. They switch between
a) Subsidies for solar in Germany cost a lot
and 
b) Having to deal with the variability of supply and demand in Germany costs a lot. 
 The first is tricky. It may cost a lot, but how much should be willing to spend to save the 1 planet we have managed to live on? Who knows. 
 As for the latter point, this is just incorrect. 
 Ancillary services represent 2.5 % of a German's electricity bill, which includes both the costs of negative and positive control reserve. 
 This control reserve takes the form of contracts between distribution companies and power generators/consumers. For positive demand response, companies sign contracts saying they can reduce their load, or increase generation, at response times varying from 1s to several minutes, and for durations ranging from 1 minute to several hours. Good examples include large pumping sites, and any manufacturing where things need to be cooled or heated. 
 For negative response, customers sign contracts promising to increase load, or decrease generation. 
 This all goes on behind the scenes without normal customers seeing this happen. Europe actually has enough positive reserve at EVERY instant that if two large power stations shut down, there would be sufficient reserve. 
 So, we've already worked out that reserve capacity represents about 80% of 2.5% of wholesale energy costs (i.e. even lower if you include retailer cut), but how much of that cost is actually due to Renewables? I can't provide any hard data, I'm afraid. My answer would be, however, not very much. 
 Customers who sign contracts saying they can provide reserve auction to win those contracts. If there is need for more reserve, or less ability to provide it, price goes up. 
 The reasons that I have heard for high prices have been as follows 
 Heating and air condition. People selling reserve capacity in the USA have been making a killing lately due to some heatwaves going on. New Zealand had a good day 2 days ago due to a cold snap. The weather is unpredictable, and coal/nuclear both need large amounts of notice to change generation.
Testing/maintenance is the 2nd most frequent. 90% of the time this has been of the distribution network, not generation.
Those two together cover almost all cases. Apparently in New Zealand there can also be spikes during drought, as the country is significantly (57.6%) hydro powered. Compare that to the handful of percent of solar/wind in Germany and you start to see that this is less of an issue.","This sort of event is unusual, the chances of it happening are not significantly increased by the presence of solar/wind in Germany, the cost is insignificant, and not significantly increased by the presence of renewables."

 The trouble is that it empirically doesn't work, as all the politicians caught doing weed, crack or gay prostitutes proves. 
 More likely I don't think it's a conscious, intellectual thing at all.  More likely it's the result of  projection  against their own demons. 
 Despite their bigoted and extremist rhetoric and efforts these people are ultimately tragic figures who should be pitied, not hated.  They're essentially miserable people, at war with their own desires and orientations and living in a constant state of oscillation between obsession over whatever forbidden fruit they crave, terror that anyone else will find out about their secret passions and crushing guilt whenever they eventually crack and indulge them. 
 They try to repress and deny their desires until they can't stand it any more, then binge on them until satisfied... then once it's over they immediately begin hating themselves for their ""weakness"" or ""slip"", and that hatred and guilt and shame is sublimated to fuel their fire for condemning others for the same transgressions.  They also often seek to avoid admitting personal responsibility, and shift responsibility to the act or the object of their desires - they talk about their ""mistake"" or ""weakness"" and vow to double down on fighting against whatever they're uncomfortable about, when everyone with half a brain can see it's  just how they're wired , and the sooner they acknowledge that and start managing it appropriately the better for everyone. 
 It's the same process whether it's a right-wing, anti-drugs politician caught with weed or crystal meth, a homophobic ""family-values"" politician caught in a public toilet giving some dude a blow-job, or a paedophile who goes to work on policies combating child abuse on the internet. 
 In each case there are better ways to handle this orientation or desire (for homosexuality, just accepting it as part of their identity and working to de-stigmatise it and increase tolerance; for drugs, seeking help for their addictive nature or campaigning for decriminalisation and responsible drug use; for paedophilia, accepting their problem and seeking help for it) that would help to de-stigmatise the issue and move society forward, but sadly instead these people (twisted up by decades of guilt, power-obsession and authoritarianism) often tend to gravitate towards positions of power and authority, and would rather try to win pyhrric victories demonising and making society  more  intolerant towards the people wrestling with these problems, rather than simply accepting who they really are and acting appropriately to destigmatise and handle/ameliorate them in the long term.","I suspect it's less ""ban gay marriage so people will stop being gay"", and more ""being gay  has  to be a choice, so I can  choose not  to be gay""."
worldnews,c5lgxrp,"Agree that the Philippines is still culturally a feudal society where patriarchy and patronage still reign supreme, especially in the provinces. 
 However, part of the reason why the Marcoses were able to stay in power for so long and was not overthrown by a different oligarch altogether (Cojuangcos for example) is precisely because of US support -- both militarily (through arms), economically (through debt and corrupt dealings with US corporations), and in the world stage (ie recognition and legitimacy) 
 Mass support for Marcos started in his home province of Ilocos Norte, and to this day the support is still there. But the further you go south, you won't find the same level of support as you might think. 
 One important thing to note is that a lot of the oligarchs these days  became  oligarchs because of Marcos -- former cronies that became rich because of their support for his regime. 
 Blaming the Filipino people for the kind of government they have now is also not quite accurate -- first of all Marcos was initially elected into office because by all accounts, he  was  a brilliant man, and his first few years in office were a few of the best years the Philippines ever had. Although ultimately it lead to a dictatorial regime that people did not expect, he was voted into office because of his merits and qualifications,  not  because of his personality or his celebrity. People continued to support him well after his intended duration as President because in the context of SEA history, people were expecting him to be the Philippine equivalent to Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew or Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamed -- a strongman that will bring discipline to Filipino culture and politics. Hindsight is 20/20. 
 After which, they voted for Cory primarily as a symbol. Salvador Laurel, who was infinitely the more qualified candidate, stepped aside because the more important thing at the time for the snap elections was a person that everyone can rally for against Marcos regardless of personal politics. Cory's administration had its ups and downs (more downs actually), but given its context, I'd argue Cory was necessary. 
 After Cory, the people elected Fidel Ramos, who wasn't that bad as President, and played a role in the Philippines somewhat slower recovery during the 90s. 
 After Ramos, Joseph Estrada was elected. On face value electing Joseph Estrada (a B-movie star) sounds really stupid, but again you have to look at it in the larger context -- Estrada worked his way up in politics from being mayor of a small town, to a congress man, to a senator, then vice-president. On paper, he  was  qualified. Whether or not his aborted administration was good for the country was debatable. It still is. 
 Gloria Arroyo took over after Estrada, who, some still insist (with some convincing evidence I might add), cheated her way into the presidency twice (first via the 2nd People Power revolution), second through the 2004 elections where she won with help from the Ampatuans of the south). But assuming she was legitimately chosen by the people, she was not a bad candidate (PhD in Economics) per se. The Philippine economy actually grew during her tumultuous time in office, and although she's the most vilified president since Marcos (for good reason), some good did come out of her presidency. 
 Now we have Benigno Aquino Jr, son of Cory. Perhaps the least qualified of all the recent presidents (unimpressive record in the Senate), he was voted in on an anti-corruption platform which, at some level, he  is  working on. Although there have been some missteps, it's still difficult to say whether his administration will be a good one or not. We will see after the midterm elections next year. 
 My point being, the problems of the Philippines and its government has less to do with people's choices (which are arguably not as idiotic as they look like) and more to do with the institutionalized corruption already in place. It does not matter who is chosen at the top if this corruption is maintained. The fact is however, undoing the generations of crony-ism and corruption that Marcos established in the government is more difficult to do than simply ""choosing"" someone different as the President.","Nobody in the Philippines ""chose"" to be poor, or hungry, or uneducated. The situation in the Philippines is a lot more complex than what you make it out to be, and the solutions for it are equally as complex."

worldnews,c16jfbr,"It's an interesting view, but I don't agree with many parts of it due to it needing some longly drawn bows required to substantiate those views. It's not paranoia specifically, but more fanciful/narrow thinking. 
 For example: 
 An owner of a website can already remove large swaths of seemingly public information just by turning off their web service. Anything that isn't queried and copied will be gone. We've already seen the result of facebook and twitter going down. If they go down permanently we'd just make a new one. 
 The concept of ""walled-garden"": 
 The problem with the concept of a walled garden is that it can be anything as simple as a database of your information, the web thrives on not making everything a static page and fully available. The interactivity of databases and live queries give the web it's 'killer app' to deliver highly customised information in tidy packages. However the database itself is never online, it exists for as long as the website owner allows it to. The walled garden isn't the problem per se. 
 Some examples aren't actually examples: 
 The author forgot to note that iTunes has a web-only counterpart where you can tweet and search all of that 'richness' without needing iTunes. (iTunes is only needed for the actual purchase.) It's more available than any login website and I don't think removing login websites is the way forward to a more open web. Levels of security are what drive the web, snaring users to share their information for mutually productive use. 
 What I view as the actual threat, with history showing: 
 The real threat to the web is not complying to the standards that are set for the web, IE6 for example did more damage to the development to the web than anything AOL could muster by having the recipe for christmas cookies available only to their subscribers. It's not the content that damages the web as any business can take advantage of closed content by producing an available counterpart - rather it's the tools used to create the content. If you can't view a webpage from a web browser whose sole purpose is to display webpages then you're damaging the web. Platform specific apps that feed from the internet, but aren't viewable over the internet pose no threat to the development of the web itself - there is nothing stopping the web version from happening. More succinctly: custom services run by just one company aren't the issue, they don't take away from the web, they add reasons to use it.","my view is that the one true threat to the open web is not be-spoke standards like a walled garden (torrent anyone?), but rather not complying with the standards that are already there."

In a flagrant conflict of interest, the Dulles brothers and Sullivan & Cromwell were on the United Fruit payroll for thirty-eight years.[7][8] In fairness to the Dulles brothers, recent research has disclosed other passengers on the United Fruit gravy train: 
 John Foster Dulles, who represented United Fruit while he was a law partner at Sullivan & Cromwell – he negotiated that crucial United Fruit deal with Guatemalan officials in the 1930's – was Secretary of State under Eisenhower; his brother Allen, who did legal work for the company and sat on its board of directors, was head of the CIA under Eisenhower; Henry Cabot Lodge, who was America's ambassador to the UN, was a large owner of United Fruit stock; Ed Whitman, the United Fruit PR man, was married to Ann Whitman, Dwight Eisenhower's personal secretary. You could not see these connections until you could – and then you could not stop seeing them.[7]","John Foster Dulles, then Eisenhower's Secretary of State, and his brother Allen Dulles, then Director of the CIA, funded and directed a violent coup against the ruling ""communists"" in Guatemala, who happened to be interfering with the flow of profits for the United Fruit Company.  Both Dulles brothers were on the United Fruit Company payroll."
worldnews,c1jr6c9,"I am an Israeli, so take my views on this as you'd like. 
 I seriously oppose the great injustice in the West Bank, and so these days, when Fatah have done the smart thing and gone mostly non-violent, when Hamas has become much less of a menace, it is hard for me to see the West Bank violations as symmetric to the Palestinians' violations. Do note that it is relatively recent, and I think that while the settlements are a great injustice, the ""symmetric"" injustice was that of firing hundreds of mortars and rockets on population centers. 
 The entire mess of a situation that Israel and the Palestinians are in is also because of: 
 
 Refusal of the Palestinian factions to agree about a compromise that would keep Israel intact (i.e: Without millions of immigrants overwhelming it). 
 
 Many years of murders and intimidations of Israeli civilians 
 
 Hamas charter which still calls for the destruction of the entirety of Israel 
 
 Very violent response to Israel's disengagement from Gaza. Instead of decreasing rocket fire and violence towards Israel, it had just increased.","I believe that the mess we're in is both sides' fault, but that as of 2011, the ball is in Israel's park, and it's mostly at fault."

worldnews,cr6oaxn,"Everything you said is correct by itself. But the causes in my opinion are not the ones you mention. This can be proved by removing organised religion out of the society (as it happened in communist countries). The religion is out, but a dirty kind of mysticism, a fascist propaganda, a metaphysical idea still remains, as if rooted in the character structure of individuals. Religion came forth from this mystical distortion of the perception of life and the living in the first place, and it won't go away if the power of the church is politically and ideologically diminished. 
 The causes are the emotional plague, that is the destructive action of the neurotic, armored man in the social scene. It made an inroad into human society with the first mass suppression of genital sexuality; it became an endemic disease which has been tormenting people the world over for thousands of years. 
 That is the cause, in my opinion, and i 'm obligated to defend this even if it is all angrily dismissed by so many people who don't even want to look upon it all, prefering to blame society, authority, state,  leaders, police, church and ideology (no one asks where ideology comes from and what it is exactly) ... and trying in vain to solve this problem politically for so long, all the while blaming the sick for the sickness.","Religious ideology stems from distorted & mystified life feelings & emotions in the armored individual, and is just a symptom of an emotional disturbance, not the root of all evil.

worldnews,c520z79,"Some traditions live for a long time; traditions like circumcision has been around for millennia. I think what we are seeing is just one small part of the decline of this particular tradition. 
It's a procedure favored by many reasons: Hygienic, cosmetic, religious (traditional), medical, practical, strategic (!), social. 
 As long as these reasons outshine the hassle of the procedure itself (controversy, necessity and so forth), the procedure will remain a part of society. The reason to do it because of the tradition itself is becoming less and less prevalent as we evolve as a society. In essence, we aren't as compelled to alter our bodies just to  prove  something. 
 (I don't think the proposed ban on circumcision is a big deal, really. The procedure itself isn't life-defining. What makes me support the ban is what other commenters have pointed out: It's so difficult to reverse. I don't really mind parents infringing on their kids' rights to a certain degree, but close to irreversible actions could mean a lot more than the parents are willing to take responsibility for.) 
 This is a more a tradition than anything else. As such, it will die out, the reasons for keeping it will wane more and more, and it'll be replaced by something else when the time comes, be it in a hundred or a thousand years. That doesn't prevent us from discussing it, but I say there's no use lamenting it.

If you look at the structure of groups if the government began to become too powerful and infringe on the rights of the populace then people would have to look at other organizations to work to rectify the change.

worldnews,c22qly7,"What's important to note here is that many Islamist resistance groups from Algeria to Indonesia picked up the title as a manner of reinforcing their clout after Al-Queda came into the limelight.  A former boss of mine referred to it as AQ Corporate and AQ Franchisees, I've always thought that an apt description.  So while organizational standards are variant between the sub-groups, there is still a common interest in the dispelling of western ideology from their homes.  There is also coordination at times between the franchisees, looking to hone their operations.  No one within the industry (national security/foreign policy) has any illusions about this, it's just easier for media to paint a simplified picture of the organization. 
 But your classification that ""anybody can be in it"" isn't exactly true.  There's a strong ideological basis that has to be met for franchising rights.  That said, it's definitely the scary buzzword.  For instance, before Al-Queda in the Islamic Maghreb existed, the organization was called al-Jamaa'atu l-Salafiyyatu li l-Da'wati wa l-Qitaa, or in english: Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat.  This was an offshoot of an earlier organization called Groupe Islamique Armee (GIA) that fought in the civil war of the '90s. Al-Queda definitely simplifies the image of what was once a group of Islamist Algerian revolutionaries against western governmental forms/intervention. 
But nuance isn't exactly the hallmark of our media.","Al-Queda operates like franchised businesses, allowing formerly disparate revolutionary/terrorist (matter of perspective) organizations to unite under a common banner.

worldnews,cinjo2u,"Technically, all Catholics believe in a literal view of the bible. However, there is a difference between taking a literal view and taking a literal ist  view, as creationists and fundamentalists do. 
 A literalist view takes everything the bible says as the absolute truth. If the bible says the world was created in 6 days, then by golly it was created in 144 hours. The Garden of Eden was where man was first poofed into existence 6,000 years ago? Well then, millions of years of fossil history are just wrong. If the bible says it, a literalist view believes it as historical fact. 
 The Catholic church, on the other hand, takes a literal view. A literal view believes in what is written, but also understands that metaphors and symbolisms can be used to give more impact to the lesson an author is trying to impart. 
 The Catechism of the Catholic Church says ""The literal sense is the  meaning conveyed  by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis,  following the rules of sound interpretation "" (CCC, 116). 
 The official Catholic belief is to take literally the message that the various biblical authors are trying to convey through stories, parables, hymns, letters, prayers, etc. The story of Adam and Eve does not in any way provide irrefutable proof that man came into existence 6 days after the world was created. What it does give is a message of morality and the dangers of succumbing to temptation, which is meant to be taken as a literal message of morality and temptation. 
 Also, I feel like practitioners of Wicca might take offense at the insinuation that the Catholic Church is in any way associated with one of their covens..",There is a major difference between a literal view of the bible (Catholic doctrine) and a literalist view of the bible (Fundamentalists/Creationists).

As it's riskier to do so when returns are less likely, private actors are unlikely to do so. Thus, the only actor left is the government. 
 By increasing market liquidity and increasing overall confidence in the soundness of the long-term economy, private investors return to (or remain in) the market instead of fleeing to safer investments. 
 Accordingly, the economy grows more quickly than austerity policies would result in, so the overall effect is a positive gain to taxable amounts and, thus, a net reduction in debt (long-term).","During a recession, Keynesian policies grow an economy quicker than austerity does.

 SDRs do not use funds to create them, but rather the  values  of a basket of currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY). In effect every new SDR is is a freshly printed fraction of each of the above currencies. 
 >The SDR is neither a currency, nor a claim on the IMF. Rather, it is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members. 
 [Factsheet]( 
 The IMF tries to compel strong member nations/banks (read FED, ECB, BOJ, BOE, etc.) to purchase them from weaker nations. They have no obligation to exchange them for hard currencies. 
 As the SDR stands right now, I would hate to see what would happen in a crisis, if the convertibility into hard currencies was curtailed. Central banks would begin to realize they're holding a bunch of useless paper. The scramble for mostly USD and EUR would bid up these currencies and cause intervention by the central banks. Safe haven commodities would get bid up that are priced in these currencies, causing massive global inflation. This would be followed by soaring interest rates, especially crippling quickly expanding markets like China, India, and Brazil. 
 I know this sounds very alarmist, and right now it is. But there is a very strong push to expand the use of SDRs. As long as nations accept them, it is basically giving a single institution the ability to print Euros, Dollars, Yen, and Pounds without the permission of the respective central banks.

worldnews,cpwitp7,"Singaporean here. Amos Yee represents a lose-lose case for the authorities, there's really no way they could have reacted without drawing flak. By arresting him, they reinforce the image of Singapore as a repressive regime in the eyes of the Western world (which I largely dispute, though I won't dive into it here) as well as earn the ire of liberals here. However, if they hadn't arrested him, the consequences would not have been minor either, for several reasons: 
 
 He openly attacked Christianity, and all offensive remarks on race and religion are a strict no-no. A Chinese manager once lost her job over insensitive remarks about the minority Malays, and bloggers have been charged over anti-Muslim remarks. The police cannot compromise on this, because the sacrosanct status of race and religion are a fundamental part of Singapore's identity. 
 
 Multiple police reports were made (over 20) by members of the public, and they cannot be seen as being soft (which is something that some of the older generation accuse the present government of being; Lee Kuan Yew would never have allowed the foreign worker strike and riot that occurred two years ago to happen, they reason). Remember the Koran-burning pastor in the US? He'd have been jailed in Singapore the moment he suggested such a thing. 
 
 Lee Kuan Yew is a revered figure, heavily respected even by the political opposition. Nearly 450,000 people filed past his coffin during the lying in state, and 1.2 million (more than 1/3rd of the entire citizen population) paid their respects at various community sites. Even the most hardcore of his supporters were stunned at the immense outpouring of grief, a spectacle in an ordinarily tranquil Singapore that hasn't been seen for half a century and likely never will be seen again. The leader of the Opposition, Low Thia Khiang (who contrary to the stereotype that all opposition figures are ruthlessly destroyed, actually led a team that unseated the popular former Foreign Minister, George Yeo) delivered a tribute in Parliament that recognised LKY as the irreplaceable founder of the modern nation while noting that his use of repressive tools made him imperfect. The longest ever serving Opposition MP, Chiam See Tong was one of the pallbearers for the state funeral and came to pay his respects during the lying in state, despite being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke he had years ago. The authorities CANNOT be seen to ignore such a blatant insult on such a sacred figure, especially since the country was still in an official state of mourning. It would destroy their credibility in the eyes of the ordinary Singaporean if they let such a monumental act of idiocy pass unpunished. 
 
 Amos Yee dangerously twists and even invents (yes, invents!) facts to suit his view that Lee Kuan Yew was a corrupt dictator that Singapore would be better off without. Ironically, the very fact that he lives a comfortable at least middle-class life with electronic gadgets and a shelf full of books is something he probably owes to the changes that LKY and his team of able ministers wrought. I'm only 19, and in the past ten years I've already seen unimaginable changes happening as Singapore develops; I live in a condominium where my mother lived in a kampong (rural village), my grandparents had to sell tidbits to supplement their income while I'm chasing a career in ecology. Singaporeans cannot tolerate deliberately lying to the world that the man who utterly changed their lives was a self-serving malicious corrupt dictator, when all the evidence points to the contrary. We believe strongly that ""thou shalt not bear false testimony"" should be enforceable by law. 
 
 Singaporeans have been travelling all over the Western world to study, work and holiday for decades; a number greatly disproportionate to our population ends up in Ivy League colleges and Oxbridge. The Internet means that there is no way the true state of the outside world can be hidden from us. To imply that we've all been hoodwinked is well, quite frankly an insult to us, so forgive us if we don't rush to defend his right to rant about how shitty Singapore is when we know full well that it isn't perfect, but it sure as hell is a sight better than nearly any other city in the world. I have a friend who one would classify as deeply anti-government and who would love to migrate as soon as he can (he has a place in MIT) - and he told me quite simply that Amos Yee was just asking for it. In other words, despite all our exposure to the systems of other countries, there is a deep understanding in Singapore that this is simply something you do not do; it violates the social understanding on which our nation is built.

worldnews,c228edn,"Being a Zürich native and a car owner, I would like to express my opinion on this. 
 Zürich makes it very convenient to get around in the city and there are even commuter trains that take you very quickly out into the suburbs. 
 As I do live in town, and I am not the only car owner, parking is furiously expensive. Unless of course you get a yearly permit to park on the street, but it is near impossible to find a space anywhere. It is so bad in fact, that people park pretty much everywhere they can. This decreases road safety, increases frustration while trying to find a space. A lot of people get so infuriated that they speed in residential areas. 
 Even though Switzerland has one of the best railway networks in the world, there are a lot of people who depend on a car to do their work, shopping etc. It puzzles me that we have politicians who have never driven in Zürich lobbying for less parking spaces and greater inconveniences for the traffic. 
 Biking in Zürich is down-right dangerous and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. People on bikes here are insane, understandably so, because there is no space for them. They run red lights, hit pedestrians and have been known to be hostile. I think some of them do it for the thrill, others out of a need to feel green. Some of them even transport their kids in a wagon mounted to their bikes and behave like they would were it only their own lives at risk. 
 There is an ever growing need for more capacity and Zürich was built before cars arrived. Nevertheless, its not just the increasing population in the city, its also a geographical problem. For those of you who don't know, Zürich is at the tip of a lake, and thus a large amount of traffic is comprised of people wanting to get from one side of the lake to the other. As a result, most roads leed into the city which then obviously creates traffic jams.","Zürich needs to increase parking spaces for those that don't have an easy commute to the city, improve roads for bikes and make it easier to circumvent the city by car. 
 P.S. I walk to work."
worldnews,c6bjo11,"Wow, I've rarely seen someone be a such a cunt about anthropology.  The truffle thing was a modern example of why saying gathering isn't a profession is stupid, but if you want an example in prehistorical times, okay. 
 Here's the thing: gathering is NOT just for yourself in ancient times unless people ONLY ate what they gathered.  Which is stupid, because the FIRST FUCKING DYNAMIC OF SOCIETY IS HUNTER/GATHERERS.  As in some people hunted animals, some people gathered plants.  The hunters got more efficient at hunting than the gatherers could be because of specialized knowledge in how to hunt and the gatherers got better at gathering because of their specialized knowledge in plants.  And did one group only eat their meat while the other group only ate their vegetation?  No, because no one likes being anemic or scurvy-ridden.  They fucking traded their meat and plants, and so both had more meat and plants than either could have gathered on their own.  This is a basic fucking economic principle, specialization in process is why trading is beneficial to individuals or even countries.  It allows acquisition of resources outside your own production possibility frontier. 
 Now, you might say, ""of course they traded their shit, but that doesn't mean what they were doing (hunting or gathering) is an actual profession.""  But you would be wrong, shitbag.  They value the other guy's product more than their own, so they trade.  And that's what a fucking job is.  Trading services or products for other services or products that you value more.  That's what a soldier did back then: he traded kicking caveman ass for, let's say, food, because he was good at kicking ass and so could get more food from doing so than from hunting himself.  And the hunters he traded with were better at hunting than kicking ass, so they found it more efficient to give him food to kick ass for them.  Obviously nowadays it seems more complicated since we use currency, but since money represents the value of your labor, its the same idea: you trade your labor with someone else to provide other services that you value more.  Which means gatherers who traded whatever they gathered by say, exchanging some strawberries for some mammoth meat, or exchanging some wild onions for some sweet cavewoman pussy, had a FUCKING PROFESSION.  And you might say, ""but gathering is so simple, it doesn't REALLY require any specialization, so is it really a profession?""  But think about it: going out and figuring out what shit you can eat and what's poisonous and remembering it all is way more complicated that laying on your back and getting paid to let cavemen fuck you, so yeah, if you consider prostitution a profession gathering should be one. 
 So in closing, fuck you. realize that gatherers were that because that's what they were fucking good at, and so that's what they used to trade for other services.  Which is what a goddamned profession is.","gathering and hunting are also professions because of specialization and thus the benefit of trade, and THOUGHTPOLICE needs to learn some basic economics before he talks about what is or isn't a profession.

Like mother, sounds like horse but it's about a female, thus female-horse combined together.
You don't get that with English without knowing multiple root words. 
 The problem is that a lot of Chinese words sound similar but use different tones, like how poop and ten sound the same. But then sometimes the tones are the same.

 The idea that a few powerful men may conspire together is not maddening.  It requires no leaps in logic, no failures in cognition. It is not improbable for any reason other then people just don't like thinking it happens, and we have plenty of historical evidence that it has taken place.  History is fantastically good at repeating itself, which means it's probably happening right now. 
 Does this mean we can know where these conspiracies are with certainty? No. 
 Conspiracies, by their very nature, exist in places with deniability or natures that are difficult to ascertain. All we have to work with is probability.  There is a chance that something might not be a conspiracy, and a chance that something might be a conspiracy.

 You're misreading the statement.  She was saying that the US has no opinion on the border dispute regarding who was right.  She was not talking about having an opinion on an invasion, because no invasion had yet occurred at that point. 
 > She doesn't even mention what methods would be acceptable. She says any suitable methods. 
 Yes,  suitable  is the key word.  Also she says ""any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak,"" which clearly means some form of diplomacy. 
 > But it also does not mean we'll come fuck you up if you do so. 
 What in the fuck are you talking about?  The only thing the US did following Iraq's invasion was to kick them out of Kuwait, who let's not forget was also an American ally.  A few years later the US did try to instigate a coup and at some point in the late '90s it became official policy to oust Hussein, but how is that in any way connected to the Ambassador's message regarding Iraq's troop movements in 1991? 
 Do you really not understand this?  5 years is plenty of time to change one's minds regarding an alliance,  especially following a war , whereas the duplicitous statements made by the Muslim Brotherhood were merely a few hours apart.  It's simply amazing you continue to think the comparison is apt. 
 > when initially you are saying... Oh we're extending friendship... and more duplicitous bullshit. 
 You're not making an iota of sense.  At the time of the Ambassador's statement, the US and Iraq were allies.  No invasion of Kuwait had yet occurred.  However, Iraq had moved troops near the Kuwaiti border, and that instigated a meeting between the US and Iraq,  precisely because those troop movements were concerning to the US and the US did not think Iraq had good intentions.   That sentiment is expressly stated in the Ambassador's statement yet you keep ignoring it. 
 When Iraq invaded Kuwait, do you not realize that the US  declared war on Iraq  and entered into armed combat?  Do you really think at that point Iraq still considered the US an ally?  Therefore there was no longer any pretense of friendship after the war. 
 At this point, you're down to claiming that the US declaring war on Iraq in 1991 was inconsistent with the Ambassador's statement and therefore duplicitous.  First of all, I think your opinion is abhorrent if you think the US should have simply sat idly by as one of its allies invaded and took over another one of its allies over some minor territorial dispute.  Second of all, the Ambassador explicitly said that the US was concerned about Iraq's troop movements, explicitly said that it preferred Iraq to solve its disputes diplomatically, and explicitly said it wanted to hold the meeting to gauge Iraq's intentions. 
 If the US were really inclined to be side with Iraq during the invasion, as you so foolishly claimed, why would they say they're concerned and why would they question Iraq's intentions?  It's precisely because the US did not want Iraq to invade, and the Iraqi foreign minister himself was wholly aware of this (another point you neglect to address).  That the US declared war to push Iraq out of Kuwait (but did not go any further) is totally consistent with the Ambassador's statement.  Anything after the Gulf War was not duplicitous considering they were no longer allies.","the US was concerned that Iraq would invade Kuwait.  The US never said it would support an invasion, and the Iraqi foreign minister knew the US would be upset if that happened.  Iraq invades, the US declares war (which is the morally correct decision as well).  Iraq would be foolish to have expected the US to allow Iraq to invade an American ally.  And you are foolish for thinking the US ever said so.  I don't think there's been a single instance in American history that the US allowed an ally to invade another ally."

 Legalizing the ivory trade to a limited extent could lower the amount of elephants killed on a yearly basis. By banning ivory, the price skyrockets. This creates far greater incentive for poachers to kill elephants and harvest their ivory. 
 We live in (for the most part) a free market society. Elephants and wildlife essentially need to be treated as products or commodities. In a free market, competitiveness is king. And with the current system and higher than ever ivory prices, living elephants cannot out-compete poached elephants; the ban on ivory has caused elephants to be worth more dead that alive.

Right now, all we've done is give poachers even more reason to go out and poach. Take it or leave it, but so far the western world has failed to curb elephant poaching; it's simply time to try a new approach.

That's pretty ephemeral.  It can and has happened in the past, but that's a sacrifice of something tangible for an abstract ideology that hasn't even been described. 
 I'm just sayin'.

At  the church, when they undressed him for baptism, they saw the baby ( who was alive and reacting upon arrival at the church ) had visible internal bleeding and the priest called an ambulance immediately. 
 The parents are indisputably idiots for not having a car seat (though this, as well as an odd revulsion for seat belts is a widespread problem in Russia).

worldnews,c7hzirh,"Let me lay out my argument as best I can: 
 The Articles of the Constitution describe the  legal means  and framework by which the Federal Government can work. The Constitutional Preamble expresses the six  legal ends  towards which the Federal Government must strive.  Activities of our Federal Government are legally required to meet their legal ends, else they cannot legally act Constitutionally. 
 Six legal ends of the Constitution: 
 >We the people of the United States,in order to: 
 
 1) form a  more perfect union,  
 2) establish justice,  
 3) insure domestic tranquility,  
 4) provide for the common defense,  
 5) promote the general welfare, and  
 6) secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. 
 
 Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to: 
 
 1) declare war,  
 2) raise and support Armies,  
 3) but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years, 
 4) to make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the military.   
 
 Congress is not allowed to transfer their powers defined in Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S Constitution to another government body or organization. Powers granted by the Constitution to any branch of government are exclusive to that branch.  Any powers not expressively awarded to the Federal Government rest with the States. 
 War must be official declared by Congress, and must serve a legal end described above, in particular provide for the common defense, and Congress may not support a standing army for more than two years.   How many of the conflicts involving the U.S. military forces after President Truman officially declared an end to WWII hostilities on December 31, 1946 have had Congressional Declaration of War?  No war has been declared by Congress since 1942. 
 How many of the post WWII wars involving U.S. military did Congress raise and support armies and appropriate money beyond the Constitutional two year limit?  Many: Korea (1950 -1953, Vietnam (1965 - 1975), Afghanistan (2001- current), Iraq (2003 – 2011)  The Constitution does not permit Congress to raise and support an army beyond two years. Congress and the Executive ignore Constitutional law. 
 Consider the Oath taken by every U.S. President and member of Congress upon entering office: 
 > I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God. 
 Elected leaders having taken this Oath, are not elected to do what they ""think"" is best for themselves, or their families, or government, or businesses, or the States, or the American general public as a whole.  They are elected to support, protect and defend the Constitution, our shield against all foreign and domestic threats to our freedom, liberty, and security within territories where the U.S Constitution reigns supreme. 
 Each President and Congressman serves the U.S. Constitution, (and through serving our Constitution, they indirectly serve the people).  Seldom does Congress or the Executive constitutionally qualify their policies to the public, or in debate, when projecting military force abroad.   Across Government, a culture is emerging of blindly following the precedents set forth by previous Executive administrations and Congressional seat holders, regardless of how constitutionally wayward existing policies may be. The three branches of Government have invited scope creep.  The Executive does not petition Congress for an official war declaration, nor does Congress put on the brakes even as military operations until war is declared, or when an overseas police action moves beyond the 90 day allowance granted by Congress to the Executive for undertaking police action,  This transfer of power is legally questionable on many levels since 1) our Constitution does not permit Congress to transfer its Constitutional authority to the Executive, and 2) Congress is required to officially declare war.  Concerns as these aside, even after 90 days of military police action, Congress must declare war else operations must cease, and troops and equipment need be recalled.  Yet Congress remains quiet as months, years pass and government vestment of the U.S. military broadens and deepens abroad.  The issue never makes the Supreme Court. 
 Congress and the Executive branches have grown complacent in securing and upholding proper war authority as Constitutionally defined. 
 If our Constitution needs changing, then change it legally. Hold a new Constitutional Convention to re-frame it however politically unpopular, this may be, it a legal avenue. But until then, the Congress and the Executive branches continue on a course of colluding to operate beyond their Constitutional mandates, in severe violation of public trust.  This is a direct threat to the freedom, liberty and security of the American public; the source of its just power of government.  Illegal activities by the Federal Government have cultivated a climate dangerous to the American public. Poor domestic policy decisions have causes record high deficit and public debt through wasteful and illegal spending.  A foreign policy of proxy nation building, disregard for foreign sovereignty and interference has contributed to regional destabilization in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America.  After decades of using threats of force and the application of armed force against foreign nations posing no clear and imminent direct danger to the U.S Constitution and the American Public, has created a feedback loop that increases resentment levels towards the United States and its citizens, cultivating terrorism.","We are fast developing a culture where the public permits the Federal Government to operate beyond the legal scope of Constitutional authority. Regarding policy decisions and military applications, the U.S. Government prefers to illegally ignore Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution when convenient, rather than legally change the Constitution to accommodate modern policy.  As a result of 60 years of illegal foreign and domestic policies and decisions, the Federal Government has and is cultivated new foreign and domestic threats to the American people's freedom, liberty and security.

Tools are all based upon some set of rules, but it's up to the  person  to decide to actually how to use it. 
 Religion is a tool people use to live their lives. Some use to be total cuntwads, and others use it for good. Some use it just for the holidays. Guns are used to kill and maim. Some it use them for self defense, hunting, and target practice, and others use them to kill innocent people and wage war (largely interchangeable).

 That is a skewed and radically incorrect context to put Operation Mockingbird in. Push an ""agenda"", what ""agenda"" do you think they were trying to push? This was the Cold War and communism was a legitimate threat to American existence. The American people do not and did not have access to the information required for them to identify threats to their existence. Even if the people did have access to all the information necessary for them to see how the spread of communism was a threat to their existence, there is a good possibility and they still wouldn't have seen any threat to their existence and would not have advocated for military intervention/support in conflict x. So in the proper context, in order for the government to protect the people and look after their short term and long term interests, Operation Mockingbird was created. In a democracy, people must support the actions of the government, hence why operation mockingbird was necessary and not disgusting. 
 There will always be information that is classified that details how exactly a country is a threat, in those specific cases the people have to be convinced that this country is a threat by other means. For the interests of the people.  People who mention Operation Mockingbird in the context you have, probably think it was in the interests of the Illuminati or NWO. It was not.

Fox News was created by the Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who was the media consultant for Nixon, Reagon, H.W. Bush, and Guiliani. That is why they lie and bullshit, not because of Operation Mockingbird. 
 American news in general does not communicate lies and out of context stories on purpose. This should not be confused as meaning it NEVER happens, but it is not business as usual like Fox News.

 Religions are fundamentally as much a product of civilization as they are causal. 
 For instance, the rise of what we'd recognize as the institutional, ""official"" Catholic/Imperial Church was incredibly timely.  The Roman world was already in rapid decline, and racked by all kinds of totalitarian impulses.  Indeed, the desire to establish an official religion for the Empire predates the adoption of Christianity as such by about a century (it was during the third century imperial civil war that the last vestiges of Republicanism died, and the desire for a unifying religion appeared.) 
 People were fleeing from the cities, and found themselves at the mercy of rural land holders.  Culture and wealth were on the decline.  In truth, this was the beginning of the ""dark ages"", serfdom, etc. 
 So yes, ecclesiastical authorities have said and done some evil shit.  But I think reducing this to a ""problem of religion"" or a particular religion misses the point.

The whole circlejerk concept works both ways and anti-circlejerk circlejerks form pretty quickly, with separate-minded individuals forming their own ""in opposition of Reddit"". 
 I actually believe this  is  history in the making, as it forces the West to inspect their policies towards Putin's Russia, on a large scale. These policies - historical ones - were supposed to be guarantees of bringing Russia into the Western way of thinking (which is lazy, affluence-centered and generally not as expansive - as presented by the EU), establishing a reliance between Europe and Russia and a partnership that would enable Russia to shed its aggressive Empire-like postures to form a new bond with its previous enemies without losing face (for example the whole ""NATO+Russia"" ordeal from early Putin). 
 These policies have failed, as they didn't take into account how powerful the Empire resentments are in Russia and the Russian society.

worldnews,coki36i,"How does an agrarian society build a nuclear/hydro/solar plant? They don't have the manpower, tools, materials, or expertise necessary. The only way is if you have another country purchase, construct and operate it, something that would make you beholden to that other country for quite some time. To do it yourself you need a certain level of economic activity to be able to make producing solar, hydro and nuclear possible. It's just not feasible when you have no manufacturing capacity and 80% of your workforce is uneducated and out out in the fields all day. You still need to industrialize and coal is still the best way to provide the cheap power necessary for that process. 
 Keep in mind that industrialization is a layered process. It's essentially using rudimentary tools/technology to make better tools/technology, which is then used to make even better tools/technology and so forth. First step is mechanizing agriculture to free up the workforce for other endevours. This requires infrastructure (railways, shipyards and roads), and machinery, both of which require steel production, cement production, tool production, etc and  power . Then you start developing a manufacturing sector (classic example is textiles) which requires even more machinery, railways, steel, cement,  power  etc. Your core heavy industries and infrastructure develop to the point of supporting new types of industries, which then drive the development of yet more types of industries (and requiring yet more power) and so forth. It's a perpetually cyclic process where everything we do allows other things to be done. And each stage needs a power source that's available  at that stage  using only the existing materials, industry and infrastructure. 
 So why can't a random country build a solar plant? Because the supporting industries required for solar panel production, and maintenance are quite advanced (especially compared to the support industries needed for coal power). You can obviously trade for some of it, but to trade your society needs to be producing something of value, requiring some sort of export industry (and the supporting industries around that). But to have that export industry (and it's supporting industries) you need power. 
 So to","this: You need coal power to either produce solar panels, or to produce goods to trade for solar panels. You can't just craft them via artisan labor.

worldnews,ccq8p1q,"Drones will be around as long as war is still around.  Love them or hate them, they're another tool in the arsenal, and their use will grow, not diminish. 
 I would be asking the users of drones to stop if I were Malala, too.  They can be a terrible weapon, and when their strikes go wrong innocents can (and do, all too frequently) die a horrible death.  A Hellfire missile is a frightening thing. 
 The reason a Commander-in-Chief will opt to use a drone is that there's less of a direct risk of putting his soldiers in harm's way.  A method whereby the CiC can remove the ""bad guy"" with minimal exposure to his own guys is always going to be preferable. 
 Unfortunately, the alternatives to drones aren't any better.  Drones are used to hit targets.  The end of drone use doesn't mean the end of attempting to take out those targets, it means different methods are used.  That includes, but is not limited to, missiles launched from manned aircraft (missiles or guided bombs) or from a ship (such as cruise missiles), insertion of a tactical team (such as Seal Team Six in the removal of bin Laden), or an even larger force conducting a full-fledged invasion (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc). 
 While I don't advocate using drones (or war, or conflict, bap bap bap), the alternatives could always be worse.  The number of innocent deaths in a full-fledged invasion will increase by orders of magnitude over drone strikes.  Long-range missiles aren't much safer than drones for innocents, nor are manned-aircraft strikes. 
 Regarding Malala's concern that drone strikes are ""fueling terrorism,"" air strikes, cruise missile strikes, invasions or any other method of ""bad guy"" removal won't ""fuel terrorism"" any less.  Any action of this kind will create anger toward America (or whomever does the bombing) and increase the chances that someone will take up arms against the user of drones.  The difference in reaction to having your loved ones killed by a drone strike compared to any other method is negligible.  It breeds resentment, hate, anger - all the typical emotions you would expect, or that you would feel yourself.","It's a terrible mess.  Drones aren't a good answer to this mess, but ending their use won't change anything."

 As for how religions view themselves as groups, I personally am under the impression that Islam isn't significantly more united than, say, Jews, Sikhs, etc. It's just a much larger religion. As for operating in a group, I agree that Islam - being so much larger and more widespread both terms of geography and numbers, get their religious message across to a greater extent than other religions. Especially because there are so many countries that are governed by Islamic leaders. 
 But just because there are vocal leaders who claim that Muslims as a whole want one nation under Islam, it doesn't mean that Muslims as a whole agree with them. I'm not at all sure that they operate as a group any more than other religions. 
 Sure, many of them get loudly aggravated when someone insults their Prophet, and they're sure to make the news when they do. But if they really did operate so much as one, unified group, we wouldn't just be seeing fairly isolated violent riots where (mostly) young, disgruntled men throw rocks, overturn cars and burn flags. The protests should be more widespread, and it should include people from all walks of life. 
 Let's compare what's happening to something that's a conservative Christian issue: Abortion. A fairly large and influential Christian populace in the USA is more or less vocally opposed to abortion, yet it's only a minority who patrol the streets outside abortion clinics with signs saying ""Murderess! God hates you! You'll burn in hell!"" As a European watching the news from the US, I get the impression that they're a much larger group than they really are, because they  do  make the news. And I'm surprised that the moderates don't come out in force to show that they're opposed to the way the fundamentalists make them all look. 
 But why should they? They themselves know that they're not part of that group, even if they, too, are opposed to abortion. They feel so different from the protesters that they don't bother to deal with them. It's a classic case of how there's no point in trying to debate anything with idiots: You can't, because they won't listen to reason. 
 I'll argue that what we're seeing in regard to the current situation is somewhat similar. We see groups of extremely angry people burning flags, attacking embassies, and even setting a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant on fire somewhere. Yet, they're surprisingly small in numbers compared to how Muslims as a group get severely upset when their Prophet is shamed and ridiculed. 
 Interestingly, we have little to compare their reactions to. Muslims who shame and ridicule Jesus don't get nearly as much media coverage, so we don't know how Christians as a group would react. But I'm sure that if a Muslim broke into a church and burned a statue of Jesus on the cross, and it made the news to the same extent that this situation has done, we'd see violent reactions. And you know what? I can easily imagine a great number of hooligans -- with no particular Christian leanings -- joining the protesters to fuel the flames. Not for any religious reasons, but because they want a riot in which they can get an outlet for their hatred against whatever they're angry about in their everyday lives, while hiding in the crowd. Take the hooligans, religious or otherwise, out of the crowd, and you get a whole different protest - and probably one that a much larger number of intelligent, educated, ""middle class"" Muslims would support. 
 Because, seriously, how many intelligent and informed people would burn a German embassy or a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant for something that a handful (at most) of hateful individuals in the USA are guilty of?","Nothing to see here, except one person's opinion, which doesn't matter any more than anyone else's. :-)"

worldnews,clsxcrf,"I see this much more as shades of gray than black and white, and I'm not sure what you're actually arguing. Isn't this basically about who controls what economic decisions and how? If we're clear on all those details, what does it mean to argue about ""which system"" it is as a whole? Why does it need to be shoved into one box or the other? 
 Basically, I'm not sure what you really mean when you say ""Elements of both are seen in every developed country, including Norway, but you can't have both systems working at the same time."" Do you just mean that one system has to be dominant, or perhaps that there is some crucial central part of the decision-making that must have either a more socialistic or capitalistic solution, and that the whole should then identified by that label? 
 I don't have any need to say ""Norway is socialist"" or ""Norway's system is socialism"", so I don't know why this would be a meaningful issue. We might just agree on your point. 
 My general thought is that markets are fantastically useful but that they also have to be regulated in order to reliably serve the interests of society rather than just the interests of capital. I'm also in favor of public (rather than private) control of a resource or industry if it is prone to a natural monopoly, since I feel that public monopolies serve the interests of society better than private monopolies. When functioning markets can be sustained for a given resource or industry (including viable competition), then that is preferable, and the state's role should be to preserve the functioning of the market. I'm more concerned about competitive markets than ""free"" markets. I think that laissez-faire markets tend to become monopolistic and cease to function effectively.",Markets are great but we also need the state to preserve competition and prevent externalized costs that harm society.

 >The only countries in the Middle East that does NOT want Iran to be a super power are the two powers we support the most - Israel and Saudi. Coincidence? Nope. 
 This is my point. WE, the US, have an anti-Iran policy and we work in concert with our allies/assets in the region to enforce that. We're in agreement on this, as is Chomsky. I don't know what you're missing here. 
 >Israel, however, has a significant say in what kind of policy is implemented in the Middle East. 
 Yes, but they didn't just up and decide that the U.S. should hate Iran and forced us to do so. We agreed together that Iran opposes both of our interests there. If you think that Israel is wagging the dog here, controlling US policy in the region (as you seem to be implying), you certainly aren't providing any evidence or even really making an argument to that effect. You're just stating it loudly and calling me dumb for explaining otherwise. 
 >Secondly, you missed my entire point as to WHY Israel is powerful. It is not because of some intrinsic ability - if Israel loses its billions of dollars of aid packages and military equipment we give them their strength will collapse substantially. 
 No I am not missing your point at all. Again, we're in agreement on this and you can't seem to see that. Obviously the U.S. gives Israel a ton of support, and without it, they would not be the military power that they are. I never said there was an intrinsic ability there, I merely pointed out that they have an actual economy and independent abilities. They are not akin to, say, West Berlin in the cold war who had literally no chance if not for massive US support. 
 My point was simply to say that it is completely irrelevant whether they have intrinsic military power or not. They HAVE it, one way or the other, so they are valuable to us. The fact that we made them that way  effects this not at all. We made a powerful country in the middle east. They are our ally. What's the controversy here?

worldnews,cio5q4b,"I'll try to make clear where I'm coming from. I won't pretend to have the answers. Long post coming up. 
 Regularly in this sort of thread, someone will make comments about revolution and overthrowing governments as the only remaining option for change. They often make overt references to guns and violence. Bannedfromhere's quote doesn't go that far, but I'm thinking of the more extreme comments when I respond. 
 Suppose large numbers of Americans were to rise up for the sole purpose of toppling the national government. They pick up their weapons or protest signs and march on Washington. The government and army could kill every last one of them but aren't willing to go that far. So the army stands by and the government resigns. 
 What happens next? The movement was born from the desire to kick out the existing leaders. Who picks the replacements? Do the people who first called for revolt step forward to lead? Do we want them to lead? Do multiple factions start fighting for leadership, as we see in other unstable countries? Do they all find themselves pushed to the side by a charismatic leader with more powerful backers? Does the army step in to maintain order and start a new election cycle? If the next move is a fresh election cycle, how is that fundamentally different from life before the uprising? If it's not a fresh election cycle, how exactly are these unelected revolutionaries going to fill the void? What are bodies like the NSA and FBI doing while all this plays out? 
 At worst, you replace a corrupt electoral system with local warlords, dictatorships, paralysis, chaos, civil wars, and most damaging, a collapse of the legitimacy of civilized transitions of power. The true strength of electoral systems isn't their representation of the masses. It's their ability to juggle competing factions who might otherwise use more traditional and bloodier methods to fight for control. It's easy to set factions against each other using all means at their disposal. It's hard to get them to share power and respect the legal tradition. Look at the ongoing struggles of smaller countries to move forward after military coups. 
 At best, you get a replacement civil government with more robust protection against corruption and abuse of power. But to get that, you have to  have  it planned and ready to go. If you can plan that kind of government and set up the organization to put it into place during a chaotic power vacuum, wouldn't you be able to do the same thing in the existing system, avoiding all the uncertainty and likely downsides of a revolution? 
 It isn't that using elections to drive change is  easy  or guaranteed to be possible. It's that  if  you're in a position to topple the government in a way that  isn't  an armed coup by a small, organized faction, you  should  already be able to direct your power into getting your chosen leaders elected for a peaceful transition. If you're going to go through the trouble to organize a proper, successful, popular revolution, you should have all the tools you need to run a successful election campaign. If not, you're risking the worst case scenarios I described. 
 I like looking backwards from the desired finishing point to see how you'd get there. If you wanted to rewrite the rules of government without a revolution, you'd need to elect the right people for it. The existing parties aren't going to play ball unless it's their only choice for political survival. So you'd need a popular movement built around fundamental reform of the system, with  clear  objectives like pre-written amendments to the constitution designed to break the power of political parties. Then you'd need candidates willing to place the enactment of those changes above all other priorities. A very tall order, but is it really impossible? Couldn't there be a set of reforms that the majority of the country could agree on, and people with enough integrity to put aside their distaste for politics and each other's views long enough to enact the reforms? As long as the goal is a vague ""topple the government,"" there's nothing for the majority to rally behind. Much like the 1% movement faltered without a clear enough direction and endgame. 
 Political parties don't entrench without learning a lot of tricks to stay entrenched. If an issue is too strong to bury, they will try to co-opt it. A successful electoral revolution would need to sidestep the mainstream parties as much as possible, or risk losing control of their message and having their reforms gutted at every stage. So you'd need organization, clear goals,  good  reforms ready to go from the first day, and enough popular support to stand up to the two major parties and their backers. In other words, the same things you'd need before starting any other kind of revolution. 
 Am I being too vague or simplistic? Sometimes when things are clear to me it's because I see what's hiding at the center, while other times I'm stating the obvious and wasting everyone's time. Writing lasting reforms isn't easy, organizing isn't easy, rallying popular support isn't easy or free. Being muscled aside by finely honed political parties is very easy. So is getting muzzled by a military state. 
 But it seems to me that the  type  of solution is simple to envision. Ideas huge numbers of people can all get behind, strong leadership to promote and protect them, and at the end, a political drive to make them happen.","If you want reforms, author the reforms, argue over them until they're perfect, then organize around them and spread the ideas everywhere. If you can get that far, you can use the existing system to finish the job, no uprising necessary."
worldnews,cq79xzz,"By 1953, economic tensions caused by the British embargo and political turmoil began to take a major toll upon Mossadegh's popularity and political power. The people were increasingly blaming him for the economic and political crisis. Political violence was becoming widespread in the form of street clashes between rival political groups.[7][9] Mossadegh was losing popularity and support among the working class which had been his strongest supporters. As he lost support, he became more autocratic.[59][60] As early as August 1952, he began to rely on emergency powers to rule, generating controversy among his supporters.[60] After an assassination attempt upon one of his cabinet ministers and himself, he ordered the jailing of dozens of his political opponents. This act created widespread anger among much of the general public, and led to accusations that Mossadegh was becoming a dictator.[7][9] The Tudeh party's unofficial alliance with Mossadegh led to fears of communism, and increasingly it was the communists who were taking part in pro-Mossadegh rallies, and attacking opponents.[7][9]
>
By mid-1953 a mass of resignations by Mossadegh's parliamentary supporters reduced the National Front seats in Parliament. A referendum to dissolve parliament and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99.9 percent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against.[61] The referendum was widely seen by opponents as a dictatorial act, and the Shah and the rest of the government were effectively stripped of their powers to rule. When Mossadegh dissolved the Parliament, his opponents decried this act because he had effectively given himself ""total power"". Ironically, this seemingly un-democratic act by a democratically elected prime minister would result in a chain of events leading to his downfall.[7][9]
>
The Shah himself initially opposed the coup plans, and supported the oil nationalization, but he joined after being informed by the CIA that he too would be ""deposed"" if he didn't play along (the experience left him with a lifelong awe of American power, and would contribute to his pro-US policies, while generating a hatred of the British).[9] Mossadegh's decision to dissolve Parliament also contributed to his decision 
 The Shah had the power to sack Mossadegh under the 1949 Iran constitution. 
 > The official pretext for the start of the coup was Mossadegh's decree to dissolve Parliament, giving himself and his cabinet complete power to rule, while effectively stripping the Shah of his powers.[7][8][9] It resulted in him being accused of giving himself ""total and dictatorial powers."" The Shah, who had been resisting the CIA's demands for the coup, finally agreed to support it.[7][8][9] Having obtained the Shah's concurrence, the CIA executed the coup.[62] Farmans (royal decrees) dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing General Fazlollah Zahedi (a loyalist who had helped Reza Shah reunify Iran decades earlier)[8] were drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. On Saturday 15 August, Colonel Nematollah Nassiri,[8] the commander of the Imperial Guard, delivered to Mosaddegh a firman from the Shah dismissing him. Mosaddegh, who had been warned of the plot, probably by the Communist Tudeh party, rejected the firman and had Nassiri arrested.[63] Mosaddegh argued at his trial after the coup that under the Iranian constitutional monarchy, the Shah had no constitutional right to issue an order for the elected Prime Minister's dismissal without Parliament's consent. However, the constitution at the time did allow for such an action, which Mossadegh considered unfair",he was a thieving Communist fellow traveller who tried to make himself dictator and then complained when he was dismissed.

worldnews,cpsa2be,"Hold on just a tick!  FSO chiming in -- I deal with TTIP mainly, not TPP, but the ISDS functions are roughly the same.  Hopefully some TPP nerd can back a brother up. 
 USTR and the white house are very clear about the intent of ISDS - ISDS is not meant to interfere in the ability to protect health, safety, public welfare, etc.  Read this write up here: 
 All of the examples you just listed are things that would NOT fall under ISDS.  As  a matter of fact we specifically define the ISDS standard as the protections afforded under the 5th amendment -- no more and no less.  A right to due process and protection from expropriation without compensation.  Regulating to improve minimum wage, reduce tobacco consumption, and protect cultural heritage sites all would be protected actions for countries.  While a corporation  could  still sue, they wouldn't win. The point of the ""future profits"" bit is that sometimes a country will create a tax or regulation that is outwardly discriminatory in nature -- like mandating foreign companies pay a different tax rate from domestic companies, which would indirectly expropriate future profits.  That is protectionism, pure and simple, and that is what TPP is about combatting. 
 I can go into further detail, but this actually helps the little guy too.  ISDS provides one standard investor dispute settlement system across the board, so a smaller angel investor won't need a dozen legal teams in as many different legal systems assessing his protections under local laws.  Also, while large companies can wait years for a court case, smaller firms cannot.  Arbitration is a much faster process (typically). 
 That being said, I expect responses along the lines of ""I can't trust that this is what will really happen, you evil corporate puppet!"" And frankly, if you don't believe that this will do exactly what the USG says it will do, I can't really help you because I also don't believe you will read up on ISDS and understand it better. I'm sorry we can't debate this in earnest -- but I'm up to chat or answer questions for those of you who are open to real discussion!","above examples aren't protected by ISDS, this is scaremongering.

worldnews,can55hg,"I just got home, I was at the protest in Rio, the biggest of them all, there was about 800,000 people there. Let me explain it to you from a brazilian point of view... When you think Brazil, you think soccer, especially with all the World Cup business going on, right? Well, I bet you'd never have thought that the president of Brazil would get the everloving crap BOOED out of her by the population in the grand opening of the FIFA Confederations Cup. The brazilian people are tired of living in a country where THIRTY BILLIONS went to prepare for the goddamn World Cup, while our health care system has gone to hell and sick people are laying on the floor of hospital hallways in endless queues, while the public education system serves our children rotten food at school because it's cheaper and leaves more money to spare for the corrupt government. Of course, the income concentration in Brazil is one of the most unequal in the world, where the upper 20% of the population holds 57,7% of the money and the LOWER 40% HOLDS 11%, according to IBGE! Meaning the rich (or even the middle class) can afford private health care and education (just so you have an idea, the disparity between the public and private education systems is so huge that the government had to create a set percentile of slots for public school students as their only chance of getting into university, since they COULD NOT EVEN HOPE to compete on even ground with private school students). Which is probably why you haven't heard of many political manifestations in Brazil. When the dominant classes are content, why protest? But getting back to the World Cup, Brazil didn't have the infrastructure necessary to host it. We had to build several stadiums, just to show the world what a great developing economy we are and how we can soooo host a World Cup like all those first world countries. Investing on the actual needs of brazilian people, ain't nobody got time for that! And what is the most sickening is their ''hosting the World Cup will help the social development of Brazil'' speech… not happening, people, all the outside investments attracted by the World Cup will benefit only the upper economic classes, as long as the income concentration doesn't even out, heck, as long as there isn't an actual effort from the government to service the population in need instead of using resources to feed their corrupt schemes. And why do we even need a World Cup to grow, when they could've been helping us with the money leeched off of our taxes all along? No joke, the average tax per product bought in Brazil is from 30% to 40%. When you buy a TV, 45% goes in taxes. The government raised over a trillion of reais (brazilian money unit) in taxes in 2012. Maybe we'd actually believe in the government using money from outside investors to help us if they had made better use of our own money. But no, they're corrupt as heck. Several people linked to the Lula administration, including minister José Dirceu, the highest-ranking member of the Executive Office of Brazil (composed of ministers of state and senior advisors) were exposed in a scandal of national proportions just a few years ago. The ex-president swore he was clueless as to what his subordinates and fellow political party members had been up to, which makes him grossly incompetent at best and as corrupt as them at worst. Just so you can have an idea, President Dilma and Lula's party, the PT, spent TEN MILLIONS in buying the political support of an opposing party, the PTB, roughly 150,000 to each representative. Now, the support of the millions of people earning up to 140 reais a month (about the price of the clothes worn by your average spoiled middle class teen), they buy with programs of social assistance like Bolsa-Família, through which they take people from extreme poverty by giving them the bare money necessary to feed themselves. Yeah, what about education, health, housing, employment, security? Those poor grateful people have no idea of how much more the government owes them. Let's talk security. To say Brazil has issues with drug traffic would be a gross understatement. Police units are going inside the favelas (poor communities where drug traffic is the reigning order) and taking away these criminals… to clean up for the World Cup. Yeah, you heard me right. Because, you know, it would be bad propaganda to leave crime for tourists to see, but no worries, they're gonna be released afterwards… BECAUSE FCK THE BRAZILIAN POPULATION YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT IN THE FIRST PLACE! So, this month, the government decided to raise the public transportation system taxes in São Paulo. We brazilians weren't convinced that paying more would make it stop sucking, you see. That's not how taxes work here. The buses would continue as they always have, arriving half an hour late on average, overcrowded and stinking places were my sixty-eight year old grandmother has to stand all the way. Buses are also frequent targets for robberies, so if some guy with a gun gets on board and stops the bus and you have to hand him all your stuff, that's just life. So yeah, it's only a little raise in taxes, but the people who put up with this, the people who take the bus everyday do it not because they like it, but because it's their least-worst option, and the government is abusing that. They think they can raise the taxes all they want and the people are just gonna lay down and take it. The people took to the streets on a PACIFIC MANIFESTATION and were met by the police's violence, like they're fcking criminals. WHAT KIND OF DEMOCRACY IS THIS? What happened to our freedom? Why do we have to fear those who are supposed to protect us? How dare the government set the police violently on the protestants, violating our constitutional right to manifest ourselves? What's more, the media supported them! If it weren't for the videos on the internet, people probably wouldn't know what happened, as the main TV stations severely downplayed the police's violent and abusive actions! Of course, once the population became aware of it, their lies were uncovered and the manifestations only GREW, spreading from town to town! The prefectures are so intimidated, that some of them have been LOWERING the public transportation taxes in an unprecedented action! BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE BUS TAXES ANYMORE. THIS IS AGAINST CORRUPTION, AGAINST THE POLICE'S VIOLENCE, AGAINST A GOVERNMENT THAT PRIORITIZES SHOWING OFF TO THE WORLD BY HOSTING SPORTING EVENTS OVER THE NEEDS OF ITS PEOPLE. If you were brazilian, you'd know we're not against the World Cup in and of itself. We love soccer. The average brazilian would be pissed off if you so much as dared to claim Maradona is better than our Pelé. What we're against is us hosting a World Cup the government insists we can afford, when they apparently can't afford to invest in our people's actual needs.","THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO SELL US AS A HAPPY LITTLE DEVELOPING COUNTRY WHERE EVERYTHING IS FUN AND GAMES.

worldnews,cpalg5m,"Warning: Super super long!] 
 I agree with this. I'm pretty sure I'm a covert narcissist. For years, I've had friends tell me I'm pretty selfish/self centered, but the narcissism traits never applied to me well enough, until my boyfriend discovered the covert type. I think I match it about 90%. I felt very exposed when we were researching it and he was reading off the traits to me. Like my ""secret"" self had been discovered. 
 I was spoiled in some ways growing up, but have never felt my parents were super supportive or praising. Quite the opposite. I could do better, I could be better, my current efforts weren't quite enough. To others, they may praise me, and even occasionally praise me to my face, but many many times I have been ripped apart for my failure to be what they want me to be. For example, I just got a new job last week and my mother has already started making comments that I need a different job. This one already isn't good enough. She shoved this job down my throat, and now that I have it I still can't relax. (Of course, when I was applying to other, maybe even better, jobs, I'd just get criticized a lot about it. I should apply for jobs that they tell me to, not jobs that I choose.) 
 I'd be told not to compare myself to others, but my parents would do it to me anyway. This person has better grades, that person is more social, that person is better at math, your sister does this that, why can't you be more ..? So its like.. I wasn't praised for being better than others, but instead, I was criticized for NOT being better than others. So there were high standards (that I can't or don't want to live up to), and they were controlling to try to force me to be what they wanted. 
 They don't like when I don't listen to them, even on small things, like what jacket I wear. They'll ask me, ""Why can't you just do what I tell you?"" 
 I was also NOT the favorite child, my sister was, and everyone in my family knows it. Both my sister and my mother have apologized to me over the years for my father's favoritism towards my sister.  She would just get things, I'd have to 'deserve' it. 
 There was also always the constant threat that what I have might can be taken away. Nothing in the house is mine, not even my room or my clothes. Everything belongs to him(father), he just allows me to use it. 
 To outsiders, however, my parents can look very supportive and caring and be very praising. They can brag about us to others. And they'll be very nice to others. They'll be nicer to someone else's kids. 
 I think the lack of control and the never-being-good-enough has caused me to be inwardly defensive and create an inner self where I am good enough. In fact, I'm better than good enough, I'm better than others. Internally, I am very controlling, and I feel like things need to be done the ""right"" way or I get really upset. I also like others for what they can provide me with (entertainment, etc). I think it is a very selfish motivation to keep friends. I have high standards that others don't live up to, so part of me looks down on others for that. Part of me is aware its wrong to be like that and thinks I should treat people well regardless. 
 When I first meet people, I come off as nice and giving and reasonable. As you get to know me I share my real opinions... I am very judgmental of others, I want things MY way regardless of whats fair or not, I am very concerned with my own comfort levels/feelings and don't really consider others' feelings on subjects. I get internally angry when things aren't the way I want them to be. However, I WON'T share this part of myself until I'm comfortable with someone personally. So you can know me for years and only see my nice side, because we're not close enough for me to relax. 
 And (this one is hard to admit out loud), I want to be favored more than others. I want to get the special treatment just because. I don't want to have to 'deserve' it. I don't want to put in a lot of effort to work for it (and fail or have it taken away later). I want to just get it. I want to be worth it, by default. 
 And yes, I know it is bad to be this way (but part of me likes it). I've become more self aware over the years, and do try to force myself to be more considerate. Mentally, it is difficult though because I don't want to change for others, I want them to bend to my will. But if I think someone is worth the effort (like my boyfriend), I have been trying to be better. I do need reminders here and there, though. 
 I don't think praise created this monster.","Criticism and lack of control has made me have unrealistically high standards, and desire to be in control of everything/everyone, and for me to be above others. I felt below others growing up, now I want to be above others."

worldnews,ccexazo,"But you can't look at  anything  the US does that's in any way defense related without looking at  all  military expenditure. To do anything other than look at the whole picture is misleading to yourself and anyone you try to argue with. 
 The United States, following the end of WWII, set itself up as the predominant force standing up to the Soviets. A  lot  of countries in Europe become reliant on the United States for military protection against a possible Soviet invasion. True, many European countries armed themselves as well, setting up various plans of attack, but the primary military muscle was always going to be the United States. 
 Thus, many European countries reduced their spending on their respective militaries and gave a certain sum of money to the United States to provide them with defense. Other countries, instead of money, offered up certain political alliances, trade agreements, territories, etc etc etc. Many European powers gave up trying to prepare for an unstoppable Soviet force and instead let the US do it. 
 I am almost certain that the same thing happened with intelligence organizations. The United States quickly established itself as  the  competent military intelligence king, and I bet a lot of European countries decided that it would be easier to lend their intelligence organizations to the US CIA, NSA, and any other organization interested. In exchange, the US would provide intel to participating European countries. 
 Thus, the US would shoulder the bulk of the heavy lifting (and lets face it, not many countries can do what the US does), and in return, European countries give the US various aspects of political power in their world. 
 Plus, European intelligence groups got to have the ethical grey area of having the information on their subjects, but not actually collecting the information themselves, and thus not breaking any laws.

 There are two methods of body scanning used in airports today: Backscatter x-ray imaging and millimeter wave imaging. 
 Backscatter does indeed use ionizing radiation. This is the type of radiation that will cause cells in your body to mutate and then multiply, creating more mutated cells (cancer!). Backscatter x-rays aren't intended to penetrate through any area of the body, but superficial anatomy is still exposed to potentially dangerous x-rays. 
 Millimeter waves are a type of microwave. Microwaves are too low energy to be ionizing. This means there is a lot less potential for this method to give you the cancers.

worldnews,c27honf,"FGM comes up as a topic and yet again, discussion seems to drift to male circumcision. Do you understand the difference? Allow me to explain, after working for an asylum firm and conducting hundreds of interviews with women who were subjected to the practice. 
 FGM is equivalent to amputation, let me say that again, AMPUTATION of the female genital organ (the clitoris and labia).  At it's most extreme, FGM results in a vaginal opening no larger than the end of a pencil. All urine, and blood from regular periods has to pass through this hole.  Frequently, it doesn't, which means it collects in her vagina, festers, and can result in total infertility.  Several communities, when a woman is either infertile, or fails to carry a child to term, will be subjected again to FGM again later in life (in an attempt to purify her), 2 or 3 times.  I met a woman who had been cut 3 times, lost all 3 of her children prior to childbirth.  She was 27.  It also means that for the rest of her life, not only will she not enjoy sex, but the woman will be forced to undergo tearing of that skin every single time she is penetrated.  Every.  Time.  This in turn subjects her to infections or worse chronic conditions.  When these women try to give birth to children, they have to be cut again to allow the baby to pass through, and then they are resewn shut.  This can take months to heal, though sometimes it doesn't and these women die from bleeding out.  Frequently young girls die from bleeding out at the initial ""ceremony"" because no one will take them to a hospital in an attempt to conceal the on going practice from the authorities. 
 When was the last time a young boy died from being circumcised? Please think and maybe do some research before you try to compare the two.","quit your bitching about male circumcision, you don't know what you're talking about and it makes you sound like a moron."

I get the impression that there is a lot of misunderstanding when it comes to the Vietnam war. A large population of Vietnamese people don't view the end of the war as a triumph for their cause for independence. It is true that the South Vietnamese government was corrupted and not a great example of a democratic government but the North Vietnamese Communist government was not any better, maybe even worse. Their crimes however largely went unnoticed because of extreme censorship and propaganda. On the other hand, the problems of the South Vietnam were exposed to the world because freedom of press and demonstration was still somewhat, if not completely, tolerated. Both of my parents' families escaped to the South after the French withdrew and Vietnam was divided into half because they know too well the real face of Communism. My parents both grew up in the south during the war and even though life was hard (my mom's village in Ban Me Thuot was continuously being shelled by the Communist who was hiding in the mountains), they were happy and hopeful for the future, for going to college and pursuing their dream jobs. But that happiness didn't last long. The last years of the war were the hardest on them; they knew that South Vietnam was going to fall any minute amidst the mass withdrawal of US troops. My dad was in his last year of high school when Saigon fell. His dream of going to college was dashed because of the discrimination from the Communist government since his two brothers were in the South Vietnamese army. I have a couple uncles who were sent to the Communist re-education camp for being in the South Vietnamese army. They were forced to spend all days reciting the Communist doctrine, writing essays glorifying Ho Chi Minh, and doing hard labor in the middle of nowhere. My parents said the day the Communist entered Saigon was the saddest day of their life, and their life remained dark for the next 15 years until the early 1990s when the US-Vietnam relations started to normalize a bit.","Not all Vietnamese welcomed the end of the war. A lot of people from my parents' generation preferred to have the country still divided, and maybe South Vietnam will be as economically advanced as South Korea today.

worldnews,conzq1c,"Just to piggyback onto Dr. Jones's comment about the media needing one magnitude to simplify reporting: The American public can get away without really needing to learn another scale because of the shallow nature of most North American earthquakes. Except in the Pacific Northwest and Aleutians where there are converging margins, the seismogenic zone is really only in the top 20 km-- pretty shallow. Surface waves are a bigger deal in the most seismically active parts. Therefore the moment magnitude roughly scales to the shaking magnitude. 
 Japan sits right on top of the descending plate so there is a lot more vertical gradient in the seismogenic zone there. Thus Japanese quakes are often any of the three categories: shallow, intermediate, or deep. The magnitude is useful for a seismologist trying to work out how much stress was released in the rupture, however for the public, as you already pointed out, it's essentially useless to determine shaking due to the depth variability.",The US gets shallow quakes and can thus get away with roughly gauging the shaking of an earthquake by the magnitude.

The constant pressure to reduce costs and maximize profit is a factor as well however.

 1) is obviously not politically correct, but even more importantly it's also not in the interest of the investors or taxpayers, as the institution voluntarily gives up on potential customers. It is not to be expected that non-Muslim parents would withdraw their children simply because they aren't served pork. So the investors must clearly be in favor of option 2)

worldnews,c1402vn,"While this is blatant fear mongering, there has been a wider acceptance of cultural relativism in the human rights community. This is basically the discourse around whether some cultures clash with human rights--thus calling into question the processes by which those cultures can coexist with others. In Great Britain there are huge problems with some other cultures, and while arguments are tinged to a certain extent, depending on who's making them, with xenophobia, the fact is that cultures involved with genital mutilation, forced incestuous marriages, honor killings, etc. can be questioned. 
 Not all Muslims partake in that.

 Thing is, most of the Norwegian military is based on conscription, e. g. people who does not really want to be there. 
 The royal guard is one of the more disciplined elements of the conscript part of the army, but most of them gets extremely disillusioned after spending some time in it.

Many even say it encourages people to commit crimes, but when you point to significantly lower rates of re-offending in countries which employ more humane prison systems, they just fall back on ""prisoners not deserving it."" 
 The issue is that people refuse to think about this as society acting in its own interests. Such decisions are actually about society investing in itself, putting money in to the system to get people re-invested in society and stop the perpetual cycle of prison-freedom-return to crime-prison that is endemic in the US and UK.

worldnews,ce8vs9g,"Put simply, it would've been insurmountably expensive. For a comparison, note that the USA/NATO never tried to match the Soviets tank for tank during the cold war. For the Soviets to attempt a similar feat in terms of naval power would've meant overcoming an even larger disparity in terms of forces. For another historical comparison, note the failure of Imperial Germany's attempt to counteract the Royal Navy with a smaller number of capital ships prior to WWI. Sure, they weren't wiped off the map in the battle of Jutland, but in the big picture the German surface navy spent the war accomplishing nothing stuck in its home ports. 
 Rather, the Soviet navy was oriented toward defense and disruption (as well as nuclear strike via submarines) via submarines, along with surface ships containing maximum missiles per ton, and a large contingent of land-based naval aviation. 
 Think of it this way: In the Soviet conception of things, any (non-nuclear, anyway) war of decisive importance to its existence would take place in the form of a land war in Eurasia, most likely Eastern Europe. In such a scenario, whatever carrier fleet the Soviets could conjure, unless it could totally cut off Eurasia from the USA, would be indecisive at best, mostly irrelevant at worst (as the Red Navy was during WWII), all at the cost of implements more useful in waging a land war (tanks, artillery, tactical air force, etc.). Likewise, aside from keeping shipping lanes open, if the Soviets could thwart a seaborne invasion of the USSR, then its limited naval resources would've succeeded in rendering NATO naval superiority less than decisive.",the party thought that investing in other military resources represented a better use of limited resources than attempting the highly improbable feat of achieving global naval superiority against the west.

It's like a kid getting angry when his mother won't let him cross the street without holding her hand, or an adolescent girl who doesn't understand why she has to be home by 10:00pm.  Children are too young to understand what dangers lurk beyond their own noses.  I think we're spoiled by our comfortable and safe lives and oblivious just like them.  We've been born into a perceived reality where our biggest threats to safety are spilling coffee in our laps or having carpal tunnel syndrome from redditing too much.  We do also kill each other a fair amount of the time, so that's dangerous too.  But there are people off shores who hate us too.  The NSA is one of our appointed guards, and while they shouldn't go 100% unquestioned, we as Americans live under the umbrella of our military and government's protection.  We pay taxes, we elect leaders, we use roads, we use the internet, we partake of numerous freedoms that fell in our laps when we were fortunate enough to be born here - we are end users.  I don't think an intelligence agency that is tasked with early threat detection has the time to stop and send out global emails to the american people explaining the intricate details of everything they do as they're doing it, and full disclosure all the time would negate the goal to sniff out threats early.

And how could you have really demanded that someone develop photos while not looking at the photos?  Most everyone elected to accept the loss of privacy in exchange for getting your photos developed.  But when they elected to partake in the freedoms and comforts of being an American, they are not accepting that there are measures that have to be taken to uphold these freedoms.  Doing so might entail someone seeing you in pajamas (as if they even give any more more of a shit than the guy at wal-mart did).

worldnews,cr4gv9p,"If the US stopped intervening the China would grab Taiwan. Japan would nuclearise. Iran would nuclearise and Saudi Arabia would do so in retaliation. Russia would grab the Baltic States and maybe Finland. 
 I.e. it would be pretty much a rerun of the 1930's. Another period when the US was isolationist. Inevitably one of the land grabs would trigger a war which the US was dragged into. Like it was in 1941. The UK tried to stay out of WWII too, but was eventually dragged in over Poland, though it didn't actually fight until Germany attacked the UK expeditionary force in Europe. At that point it came very close to losing. Japan attacked the US because it saw the US as being able to stop its expansionist plans in Asia and decided rather foolishly that a pre-emptive attack would stop this. 
 At the worst point in WWII there were only around ten democracies left - Nazi  Germany and the USSR had overrun almost all of Europe 
 Right now China is equally foolishly developing AA/AD and 'Assassin's Mace' weapons to either stop the US intervening in support of Japan or Taiwan or to deal such a heavy blow to US forces that it stops the intervention. Japan has loads of plutonium and solid fuelled space launch rockets that would make excellent ICBMs. The only reason it doesn't declare itself as a nuclear power is that the US has instead put Japan under its nuclear umbrella. However if the US stopped that policy, it'd go nuclear. Of course there's no saying how China would react to that development. given that Chinese and Japanese ships clash all the time over the Senkakus. Also Taiwan and South Korea probably have the capability to go nuclear but choose not to because the US guarantees their safety. 
 What happened in Ukraine shows that Russia hasn't given up on 19th Century style territorial expansionist. It is deterred from attacking NATO powers though, primarily because of US military power. Still if the US pulls the plug on NATO it may well decide it could take out the UK and convince France to stay out of the war. In that case it could then do what it wanted in Eastern Europe. 
 Iran is non nuclear but could make nukes in a year or so. Saudi Arabia could buy them from Pakistan. Israel is an undeclared nuclear state and may well strike pre-emptively if Iran has nukes. Or it may not, it is not clear what its red line is.",the US going isolationist could easily trigger one or more wars which the US is eventually dragged into. I.e.

worldnews,ccisdq3,"The sad part is that it is possible many of these workers might not get back pay. I heard the whole rundown on All Things Considered yesterday. For the 800,000 workers without a paycheck, it really sucks, especially since those are basic middle class jobs and the workers are not wealthy. We've already had a rough go of it for five years, so chances of the workers having enough in savings to fall back on is pretty slim. The rest of the shutdown does not have a major ripple effect. HOWEVER, the looming debt ceiling crisis, which comes due in a mere 17 days, is far more damaging than the partial government shutdown. Jeopardizing the good faith and credit of the United States for a bit of political theater over an issue that has been decided several times over is perhaps the worst thing to happen. 
Two of the biggest consequences I heard yesterday of this shutdown is that the statisticians will not be able to calculate employment numbers, which will most likely have a negative effect on the stock market. Before you go and get all ""well only the rich people will be affected by that,"" remember that your 401(k) and/or pension are a part of that. I've taken one too many hits to my modest retirement portfolio over the last 13 years and I'm getting old enough now for it to start mattering. The other damage is that interest rates could be affected and mortgages won't be able to close, forcing potential homebuyers to lose their interest rate lock. It again may not seem like much, but for many buyers, a 1/4% shift in the interest rate could be the difference between qualifying and not qualifying for that loan. 
My facts come from this report yesterday, heard on NPR","The government shutdown is a pain, but not catastrophic. The debt ceiling battle will have lasting, damaging consequences to the entire US economy.

And the only reason they believe that is because there is a generational disregard for actually reading the Bible within the church, and just repeating what you hear other ""Christians"" say. 
 The Bible is very Earth-Centric, because it is the planet where humans were placed, and humans were meant to be God's companions. It goes into great detail about the creation process on Earth, because it was written for Humans. Genesis is usually where informed religious people will argue from when they say that alien life invalides our beliefs, but nowhere in Genesis does it imply that Earth is the center of the universe, or that Earth is the only planet that God created life on. 
 I'd honestly wager that the Bible could even support the existance of life on other planets! Psalms 19:1-2 says that the Heavens declare the glory of God, and their expanse shows his handywork.

worldnews,c6znkea,"Now a brief simplified story to understand why 
 First generation muslim immigrants (50/60) 
 
 Most muslims living in France are from ancient colonies, most of them from the Maghreb. 
 
 There was already a sizeable amount of Maghrebi immigrants in France before WWII, but it exploded after. They were welcome because they were cheap labour and helped rebuild the country. As soon as that need was filled, they were not welcome anymore. 
 
 They were muslims, but not over conservative. Or more precisely, they kept their religions to themselves, and were only slighty more conservative than catholics. 
 
 As many poors, they were stuffed in what we called «[barres]( and what US would call ""projects"". 
 
 This was a '60 mistake where leaders just built cities to sleep in, the banlieue, empty of any services or recreational centers. People were expected to commute. I guess during the week-ends, they were expected to drown in TV. There is a great formulae to describe this shitty life ""metro, boulot, dodo"". 
 
 So because those banlieues were so empty, there was no job around and no economical activity, because the government invested nothing, they were more or less fated to fail. Especially considering that France has a very big government. 
 
 Also, our republican school is our greatest tool at integration, or at least people believe so. When those schools fail, integration will fail too. 
 
 Not to mention the casual French racism (France is far less racist than the US, but it is definitely there) and the colonial war with Algeria. 
 
 
 Second generation (80/90), some would say third, but eh 
 
 In 81 are created  ZEP . 
 
 In the 80, people start really to adress casual racism, notably against blacks and people from the Antilles. 
 
 In 89, government is looking into banning the hijab from school, but our Constitutional Court says that the hijab is not incompatible with laïcité. 
 
 In the 90, the government started to do massively the only thing he could after so many times : destroy the barres and house people in better facilities. However, a lot of the shitty districts of the banlieue are still there 
 
 The Republic have given up on those districts. No investment, no public services (notably, no unemployment office !), and current public services are actually threatened when they go there (firemen, EMT, police, all are under the risk of being bombarded with objects when they enter those districts). The hatred against the government, and therefore France, is just growing and growing. 
 
 At the same time, a few people from the banlieues become sucessful and celebrities, model for some, token for others, anyway, at least now there are public faces speaking for those people. But they're mostly humorists, actors or athletes. 
 
 There was a little hope with the 98 football French team, whose ethnic make-up was considered a great deal and a proof that a better France was possible.  But of course, it was all for show. 
 
 It's also in 98 that the government acknowledge for the first time ever [the Paris Massacre of 61]( The French Government is usually slow to recognize its own wrongdoings. See also the [Harkis]( 
 
 Still a lot of casual racism. For instance people assume when speaking about muslims living in France that those are not French Citizens by default, while the reverse assumption should be the default one. However, given French nationality code (one of the most generous European one), they are fully fledged French Citizens, and it's racist to speak of them as otherwise : they have the same rights and duties than any French Citizen. This is still the case today, people debating the problem will be emotionally stirred and refuse to acknowledge the simple legal reality from the get go. 
 
 
 Third generation (and fourth) (00-10) : 
 
 Casual racism against the arabs is still strong in 30/40 % of the general population. White people are even worried about anti-white racism, which show how little they understand the difference between institutionalised racism and hateful feelings from individuals. 
 
 As the arab population grows, some adjustements are made locally with public services to accomodate certain of their requirements (halal foods at school for instance, muslim women asking for muslim doctors). This does not go well with our laïcité. 
 
 In 2004, a law that bans any religious signs from schools is enacted. But everyone knows that the religion was Islam, and the sign [Islamic Scarf]( There was a controvery in the medias, but really none in our Assemblée Nationale : almost every député was for it. See the wiki article to see how things shifted gradually to local initiative to ban the hijab in schools to a full national ban. That law do not go well with muslims and people from muslims countries that see it as a personal attack against them. 
 
 There were some riots in 2005. It sparked after two controversial deaths of youth in the banlieues. But basically it was hopeless youths who went around burning cars. 
 
 But contrary to what CNN reported, or many international medias, the muslim component of it is null. The RG (Renseignements Généraux, they're basically an domestic intelligence agency, and they're very well informed) found that radical islamists actually tried to quiet things down, it was local criminals that incited those riots, because it allowed them to increase their holds on the quartiers. They quickly understand that the less the government will involve itself with the banlieues, the more money they will make. 
 
 In 2007, the two main presidential candidates swore to do something about the banlieue. There was historical high turnout in those districts. But surprise, nothing was done and they were quickly forgotten. 
 
 In 2010, the Niqab is banned. There is between 1000 and 2000 women wearing the Niqab in public at that time. So, that law was pretty much a loss for our freedom than anything else (because it banned Niqab under the pretext to ban any things that could hinder identification in public). 
 
 In 2012, nobody cared about the banlieues in the elections, and turnout was back to normal lows. Positive note, a few members of Maghrebi origins in the last two government, but there still is 0 député at the Assemblée Nationale that represents them (ok maybe one today on 500 members). 
 
 Because of all the previous past events, a reactionnary Islam was born (and/or imported) in some districts.  The current Muslim youth is actually more radical, more hateful towards France, than the previous generation !  And now, here we are, with a growing discontent young radical muslim generation that have no future, no past.  They will shun women that go out, strangers from their community, a lot of things related to the government and have invented/taken from Islam a set of norms that they call hallal. For instance, for a girl to go out alone in a night club, that would not be halal, that would make her a salope or a pute (a slut or a whore).

worldnews,ch2t6zf,"Instead of doing the usual populist ""omg the government is corrupt and won't hear the case against NSA! The evil NSA is trying to collect our whole life-history to control our behavior!"" You can just merely read up on the subject try to empathize and understand the legal expert opinions on the matter. They're not making these decisions out of nothing. 
 These human beings that you dehumanize didn't become supreme court justices and federal judges by making bad rulings or illogical decisions. 
 This is what the NSA is doing with that data: 
 >For example, if the NSA learns the cellphone number of a suspected terrorist, it can query the metadata for the phone numbers dialed on the terrorist’s phone, 
 >The NSA turns over suspicious phone numbers to the FBI for further investigation 
 That suspicion does not imply guilt or detainment or imprisonment or conviction. It simply allows for more investigation into actual terrorists. 
 >[Clinton-appointed federal]  Judge Pauley  argued that under the Supreme Court case of Smith v. Maryland, which was decided in 1979, the metadata program does not violate the Fourth Amendment because the NSA collects the metadata from the telephone companies of the targets; the NSA does not monitor the phone itself. 
 >In Smith, the court held that the defendant did not have a “ reasonable  expectation of privacy” (the standard for a Fourth Amendment claim) in the phone numbers he had dialed, because by dialing them he communicated them to the phone company. 
 In other words, it is the phone company's data. NOT your data. The subpoenas are for that telecom company database--they are not yours to begin with. 
 Just like, if you sign a hospital visitor logs, that hospital visitor logs doesn't  automatically become your property. 
 >However, until the Supreme Court overrules Smith v. Maryland,  Judge Pauley has the better legal argument. 
 [Source from Slate]( 
 
 As for the history of why the Metadata program was even established: 
 >[regarding] the September 11th attacks, the National Security Agency (""NSA"") intercepted seven calls made by hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar, who was living in San Diego, California, to an al-Qaeda safe house in Yemen. The NSA intercepted those calls using overseas signals intelligence capabilities that could not capture al-Mihdhar's telephone number identifier. Without that identifier, NSA analysts concluded mistakenly that al-Mihdhar was overseas and not in the United States. Telephony metadata would have furnished the missing infonnation and might have permitted the NSA to notify the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation (""FBI"") 
 Judge Pauley in his ruling recognizes that the NSA should have regulations and  the NSA should not be unchecked (unregulated)  but says that this must be written into the law, not ruled illegal retroactively when it was  already legal . 
 And about regulation that already exists: 
 >Bulk telephony metadata collection under FISA is subject to extensive oversight by  all three branches of government.  It is monitored by the Department of Justice, the intelligence Community, the FISC, and Congress. 
 [Judge Pauley's ruling PDF](","If you are interested in this subject, please read Judge Pauley's whole ruling, he goes through the history of how FISA was established and how all these laws came into place.

 There is a ton of science behind how autotune works, involving many dedicated computer and DSP engineers. There is also a science in how to use it, and it appears on far more records than you realize because it doesn't just make the ""T-pain"" sound. 
 It takes a signal, deconstructs it in such a way that it can analyze what note the singer did sing, and allow the producer to change it to what note they want the singer to sing, then reconstruct the signal according to it's original amplitude characteristics to prevent it from destroying the tone and content of the singer, with a control on how long it takes the computer generated corrected signal to take over from the original unedited signal. Make that time short, you have T-pain. Add some variation and you have something that tightens up a vocal track, and appears on even the best singer's tracks because it's easier and cheaper to do one good take and correct it than do a thousand takes and string the best parts together.","you're wrong, and so is the analogy.

 That said, we have already emitted enough CO2 for catastrophic climate change. A 2 degree rise, which will happen even if we stop  existing  today, is catastrophic and too much. Even if we continued existing, and switched to all alternative energy in a minute, that only solves at most 4/5 of emissions. You still have deforestation as a significant emissions source. 
 What we need is a process that can remove C efficiently enough from the atmosphere that it won't take more CO2 emissions to power it than it removes. 
 And we need to be able to remove significant quantities in the next few decades, not centuries. 
 As we add ~1% more emissions every year, a process that could effectively remove enough CO2 to make a difference in the next few decades would also be able to displace this additional amount. 
 If no such process exists, then I think the appropriate triage is not to sacrifice large remaining swaths of habitat for alternative energy, as it will leave us with even less continuous habitat for organisms to migrate through, but to emphasize habitat continuity over all else, so the largest number of species can survive the apparently inevitable change.","Alternative energy is important, but only a piece of the puzzle, and at this stage not the piece I think everyone should be focusing on primarily (more important = habitat continuity and carbon removal)"

worldnews,c7hbgpb,"Welcome to the meat industry. Unless you have killed the meat yourself, you can go right ahead and make the assumption that the pig, cow, lamb, sheep, chicken, turkey, etc that you are eating has been treated this way. 
 Like it or not, meat is a business. A business is out to make money, not make friends, especially not in their own product. Animals are routinely kept ass to ass or in tiny cages, stomping through their own waste and killed in inhumane ways. Workers don't see the animals as they would see their own pets, or even as living beings, and will treat them horribly,  roughly, torturing them. 
 Shit like this is widely accepted practice in the meat industry because- guess what, it's cheap? They can mass produce  living beings  and slaughter them at low cost by using inhumane and neglectful methods. 
 Even the eggs you eat are from abused animals- I suggest you look into battery chickens. The worst part about that is, once the animals are old enough that they aren't going to produce good enough eggs, they are often tossed live into meat grinders to be disposed of, or into dumpsters. It's okay, because they are just chickens. 
 The fact of the matter is, you and I, as humans, do not require meat. We never really did. The protein and iron we need can be obtained from various vegetables, fruits, nuts, and legumes. There's no need or reason for us to eat meat except for out of convenience or flavour. Even better is that most of us would not be willing to point at a living cow, pet it on the head, and say ""yes, please kill this one, I'd like to eat it's thigh"", because as soon as we are faced with that living being it's a living animal, and not ""meat"", but are willing to pretend the abuse and horrors that exist for this ""meat"" in it's lifetime do not exist... simply so we can enjoy a steak. There's this current fad of practically fetishizing bacon as this god among meats, this delicious thing with no flaws (other than plaque in your arteries and high sodium intake I suppose...), but would they want to believe that their bacon was a living breathing animal that was smashed against bars and walls before it died? No, I can't say most would. 
 This is why I am a vegetarian. It's a healthier diet and more appropriate for my body as a human. It's cruelty free- I'm not eating anything that has been beaten and abused. It's delicious with lots of variants in what I can eat, hardly bland at all as many omnivorous people might suppose. 
 What interests me is generally when something like this comes up, people will say how guilty they feel about eating meat and yet will not stop. Then someone like me will come in and talk about it from a veg*n point of view, suggesting that hey, this shit happens, and to wave it away is kind of really shitty... and we get downvoted to hell or verbally (textually) abused as hippie assholes... because we're just reinforcing what you are feeling right now- yeah, it's really shitty to eat meat when animals are treated this way. But it's hard to change, so don't you dare make us feel worse so that we'd actually have to change. 
 Furthermore, most people today have pets, most commonly a cat or a dog. Most of those people also wouldn't snap their dog or cat's neck, or bash it against a wall, skin and gut it, and fry it up for dinner. Rover and Buttons are  pets . That's  different  from the  baby pig  you saw violently smashed against a floor in this video. I want to ask you how. It's literally just a fluke that dogs and cats were chosen as common housepets instead of say, pigs and chickens. Could have been any animal, but we just so happened to domesticate these. In many other countries, both impoverished and not, dogs and cats are seen as pets or food. The Korean Nureongi is a breed of dog that was bred, much like Holstein cattle, for it's meat. Today, Koreans are calling for a ban on selling the dogs' meat because they have come to find it morally upsetting- they came to like dogs too much. But really, there is no difference at all between a dog and a cow. Pigs are often considered smarter than the average dog, matching closer to or above the most intelligent breeds in testing of their cognitive abilities. We won't eat dolphins because they're smart, why are we eating pigs? We make up all these rules why we can't eat specific animals, but you don't look at the steak on your plate and say ""that was a cow"". You just think of it as a cut of beef. So why does it matter? 
 Anyway, I'm rambling and angry.","This horrible abuse is common practice, if you don't like it, stop supporting it and stop eating meat."

worldnews,casee6x,"To be fair, part of the problem is also that brand name drug companies typically (not always, but typically) focus on making a drug to the highest standards they can, no matter how much it costs, initially because they have no competitors thanks to patent protection. On the other hand, generic companies try and make that same drug just good enough to be approved but as cheaply as possible. 
 Now, you might be wondering why the original manufacturer couldn't just change over to a cheaper manufacturing process. There are two big reasons. The first and most obvious is that it's expensive to buy new equipment, because not only would production be interrupted, but there's also capital and installation costs. The second, and less well known, is called the Drug Master File, or DMF. This is a document that is required to be filed with the FDA before a drug can be produced. This document gives a very specific description of how the drug will be made, with precise operating ranges and processes. In order to alter the manufacturing process in the original DMF, the entire document has to be re-done, all the safety testing has to be re-done, and anyone who might buy your product for further refinement (for example if you make the active ingredient and someone else buys it to make a pill to sell) also has to completely re-file a DMF and re-test their process. You can imagine how much this would discourage changing the process to a cheaper one. I'm not saying they couldn't or shouldn't, just that it's not always as straightforward as simply lowering the price.

 Poor people can choose to do illegal things just like the rest of us. There are plenty of people from hard-up families who would never do a thing wrong. Likewise, there are many people who think it's OK to commit a crime to help themselves. If you grow up in this kind of culture, you'll be predisposed to think this way; ghettos become self-perpetuating. 
 Do people who have a comfortable living choose to commit a crime to enhance the way they live? Rarely - the risk of getting caught isn't really worth it when you're happy enough and value what you already have. 
 Poor people have less so they perceive the risk of getting caught as less (even though it's incredibly high in that it would cost you decent employment, if you were lucky enough to get it anyway). To avoid committing a crime your standards have to be a lot higher than if you were middle-class.

Virtually all industrialized countries became industrialized through some form of protectionism (the antithesis of free trade) not the least of which is the US, the only exception I can think of is Switzerland.

worldnews,c9gnvdo,"That's not true. Whites are around 70% of the US population so there is a greater net amount of white serial killers. However, blacks are over-represented as serial killers by a factor of 2 (using whites as the ""base""). So there are more net white serial killers, but per capita there are more black serial killers. Meaning that if you come across a black guy and a white guy on the street, the black guy is more likely to be a serial killer by a factor of two. 
 "" Walsh identified 90 African American and 323 white American serial murderers, all men operating between 1945 and 2004.

African American serial killers made up 22% of Walsh's sample, a figure in close agreement Hickey's enumeration. But, as blacks number well below 22% of the U.S. population, they are actually overrepresented among the ranks of serial killers -- roughly by a factor of 2.

worldnews,ckducgc,"You do pay a fortune, but over a very long time and only when meeting specific requirements. 
 I get the maximum amount of money at uni because my family aren't amazingly well off which is all of the 9k tuition fee, ~£3.5k maintenance loan and ~£3.7k maintenance grant. I also get a load of stuff from DAS for free because I'm dyslexic but that's irrelevant as I don't have to pay it back. 
 I'm about to go onto my placement year and I get £1.5k maintenance loan because it's a paid placement and have to pay a £900 tuition fee still. 
 So that's £26,900 tuition fee for the 4 years and £13,000 living costs as you only pay back the loan. This totals up to £39,900. 
 The way you pay it back changed when the cost of tuition went up so now you only start to pay it back after you start to earn £21,000 or more. When you pass this threshold you only pay back 7% of you wage a month so it scales with how much you earn. 
 A graduate Software developer job (I'm on Computer Science) is around £24,000, 7% of this is £1680. Senior software devs go up to £50,000 of which 7% is £3500.
Let's assume after working for 15 years you go from £24,000 to £50,000 (10 @ 24k and 5 @ 50k). We have.... 
 £1680 * 10 = £16,800
£3500 * 5 = £17,500
£16,800 + £17,500 = £34,300
 
 Previously we worked out that total of my uni costs are £39,900 so... 
 £39,900 - £34,300 = £5,600 (less then two years).
 
 So in less then 17 years you've paid off your debt at a rate that's not that bad if you consider that I'm using the yearly figures rather than monthly. 
 This is a best case scenario situation and haven't included any other pay rises you'd get between going from grad to senior, plus the transition could be quicker or slower depending on the individuals ability. 
 Assume a worse case senario and you don't get a job, then you don't pay it back. Assume you don't ever earn enough to pay it back in full then it's scrapped after 30 years.

However, expect to pay upto $100,000 for a lens that can zoom right in.
These are considered ""professional"" cameras but this is very much open to interpretation as to what ""professional""actually means. 
 For example, a Canon 350D is a DSLR it has 7 mega pixels and swappable lenses. The Lens that comes with it is mediocre - the zoom is limited and taking pics at a distance would come out poor because of camera shake. ( I have one of these)  Under the ruling, it would be banned in a public place. 
 Conversely, a new Panasonic Lumix (I have one of these too) has 14 megapixels and can zoom in further than the Canon 350D. Coupled with the Image stabilising effect. The pictures are of far higher quality when taken in similar conditions. ( this is more apparent the darker the environment becomes) 
 You can shoot in HDR for even more definition with a single shot on the lumix - and look like a tourist. Oh and did I mention you can shoot HD video too ?",A Panasonic lumix takes better pics than a Canon 350D DSLR but the lumix wouldn't be banned. This is a fucking stupid rule.

worldnews,cloc9nt,"Actually it still applies as much now as then.  The difference is the depth of strategy and tactics.  To say that strategy is pure strength or weakness is to over simplify even what he was writing about at the time.  Appearing weak or strong is a multi-layer strategy and always has been.  For example: you show your strength, twice as many troops as your opponent but you deliberately give half your archers sword kit and keep their bows hidden away.  Opponent bets on his archers, attacks, your archers come out with full bow kit and it's on.  That's the ancient method. 
 New method, you send prop power heavy bombers virtually unescorted near territory you'd like to send a message to.  This is a joke.  Any nation with modern jets can scramble and intercept those bombers practically before they left the ground, and in fact with modern satellite surveillance this is actually very possible.  Except, we are not 100% certain of the ready state of their AA and interceptors so the bombers do get off the ground.  Once in the air without fighter escort though, heavy bombers are just flying scrap metal.  What is the real message being sent here?  It was never about attack posturing. 
 In response, we're sending the NATO community is sending F-16's to intercept.  This is a joke.  Not that the F-16 isn't a highly capable combat aircraft but sending a couple a F-16's out is just another way of saying, 'Yo, message received.' 
 If we'd have wanted to send a different message various countries would have scrambled F-15's which is a whole different threat level to heavy bombers even with escorts.  That message would have essentially been, 'Yo.  Message received.  Fuck off and don't do this again.' 
 If we were even remotely concerned about it, we'd move naval assets into place and those F-15's would have been joined with F-18's to assist long before they ran out of international air space to play in. 
 And yes, this is all possible with the amount of information we know about each other.  The real posturing that relates to the appear weak when strong and vice versa advice is the readiness state of our various combat forces.  Intel can easily show X number of combat air craft at a given base, or naval forces in place in various waters.  What it can't necessarily show is if all of those combat aircraft are A) Air worthy B) Combat worthy C) piloted in what manner (rookies, vets, etc...) and what condition logistics is in.  We can take some bloody good guesses but this is where the real deception happens.  Hell at various points we can't even tell how many assets each uses.  Various decoy programs can fool just about anyone that isn't on the ground staring at them from a close distance.

worldnews,c9jba23,"In order to understand the problem(s), you first must understand European society. 
 Europe never had these problems before the 90's. 
 Mainly Northern Europe and some countries in the West ( like Belgium, Luxembourg ) have a very timid attitude. 
 Since the latter part of the 20th century, there has been a high influx of Islamic immigrants from Arabian countries. 
 The general attitude of the people in these countries is very different and opposite to the attitude of the countries they are immigrating to. They are very extrovert and aren't shy of any attention - whether positive, or negative. 
 This gives them a lot of power over the citizens and the people who run the country in general. 
 European Police officers usually only had to deal with traffic violations and low-profile crimes. Because of the introvert and timid attitude of the citizens, law enforcement has always had a relatively easy job since they received a high rate of respect from citizens: They only had to watch to someone in a certain way, and the person would already know that he was doing something wrong. 
 Suddenly, society gets filled with extrovert big-mouthed Arabs who show not a single sign of respect to police officers. The effect is NOT that police officers suddenly became pit-bulls walking around with drawn weapons overnight. No, what really happened is, that police officers decide to stay away from certain ""trouble"" areas as they call it. 
 That's right, they are afraid. They have never been trained to deal with the intimidation that they now receive from these ""new"" citizens. Immigrants noticed this and quickly learned that they could get away with anything here. Since citizens are equally afraid, they know that citizens are not going to defend themselves against any violence. 
 Crime by immigrations is a serious problem in Europe, and the one country is more prone to this than the other. There is a prison problem in Europe: the major percentage of the prison population is non-European. There aren't enough prisons that are being created to keep up with the prison population, so more and more crimes are left unpunished. This creates a vicious circle in which there are more people who do crimes because now they know they WILL get away with it. 
 Europe has become some sort of Disneyland for Arabian immigrated criminals. And then I haven't mentioned the big religious gap. They are Muslims which creates a strong ""us vs them"" feeling among them, giving them a God-given superior feeling, above Europeans who are by their definition: non-believers. 
 The politicians seem stuck in the 20th century and aren't growing any balls to handle all of these new problems that we are facing. Ok, they are trying, and they are admitting that the ""world is changing"", but the tempo of change is really low. The changes are out-pacing the political responses to the changes. 
 Gang-rape is a big problem in Europe, and it's a very new problem. It's a new form of crime, coming from the middle-east. But saying that out loud, is racist, of course. 
 Actually, naming any of the new problems is racism, because you are not supposed to blame a minority for being responsible for something negative. I yet have to hear about the first gang-rape performed by non-Arabs though.","If you want to understand the problem, you should. I experience that a lot of Americans just ""can't believe it"" and suppose that we are right-wing republicans living in Europe. This is not true. There IS a problem that you don't get to see in the USA, because you have a very different law enforcement system and some really good filtering at your borders."

 I've had good experiences and bad experiences, for sure. Sometimes you will get a client that is really putting pressure on you/your firm to finish a project quickly. There is a lot of competition in this field so archaeology firms are always fighting to keep the client happy so they'll have future rapport with them. 
 The worst I ever had to deal with was a firm I was working for was encouraging us to survey at wider intervals to speed up the project, at the client's demand. Pretty much all of the archaeologists knew it was bull shit and made it known that we knew it was wrong. On top of that several of us went to the state historical society and told them of the wrong doing. Our firm shaped up, stopped taking the client's bullshit, then got future work with that client because the other firms they had working with them all got caught cutting corners by various historical agencies. So, it actually ended up pretty good for all involved (except maybe the client who ended up with a slower project time in their attempt to expedite things).

 The article claims 390 ""structures"" were torn down last year. The word ""structure"" is carefully chosen to exaggerate the number as much as possible. The word ""structures"" includes many things which are not ""homes"",  like  garden shacks and car garages. 
 According to the UN the number of ""homes"" torn down last year in the West Bank  was  175. 
 Even this 175 number is exaggerated because most of these 175 were tents not buildings and were counted multiple times as they were set up and taken down multiple times in one year.

 Palestinians issue their own building permits in the areas where more about 98% of the Palestinian population lives, with no Israeli interference at all. 
 Not one single Palestinian home is ever torn down in these areas, which include all major Palestinian cities and towns. 
 The Palestinian housing construction  industry is very large, far larger than the Israeli housing construction industry. Over 20,000 new Palestinian homes are constructed every year.

worldnews,c6ih8dp,"I'm going to play devil's advocate, because A) I am of two minds about this and B) I enjoy playing devil's advocate whenever possible. 
 I should also note that I am from the U.S. and am not familiar with how bad the gender disparity is in the EU. It's kinda bad over here, but not like an order of magnitude. 
 With the exception of life insurance, it is my understanding that most insurance industries are pretty reasonable and don't actually turn crazy profits while twirling their moustachios. It seems reasonable to me that if one were in the business of insuring people for potential accidents, that it would be fair to use statistical information to determine how much to charge what clients. 
 Charging men more and women less isn't really discrimination in the negative sense, I think. It's profiling and prejudice, for sure, but it's backed up by facts. The company isn't necessarily making more or less money by doing this, they are just being reactive to what sorts of clients they get and indirectly encouraging lower-risk groups to take on the task of driving more than higher-risk groups. 
 From the perspective of the insured, I think there a different question we need to concern ourselves with: 
Are insurance companies abusing their profiling systems to compete with each other, and is that abuse hurting high-risk groups beyond reason? 
For example, if Dreadgoat Auto Insurance (DAI) notices a trend of more female drivers, we may decide to drastically lower the cost of insurance for women and offset the loss by raising it for men. Or any other low-risk / high-risk group. That last bit is important.  Any low-risk / high-risk group. 
 If you feel this is harmful, then the practice of adjusting rates based on what type of people have more expensive accidents is what needs to be addressed. Not gender discrimination. If, on the other hand, you feel it would be unfair for everyone to pay the same, whether they are low or high risk, then the gender ""discrimination"" should continue. And the age discrimination, and the discrimination based on previous incidents, and the discrimination based on race, medical conditions, make and model of car, length and location of commute, etc. etc...",Adjust premiums or don't.

worldnews,c0vsstk,"I feel compelled to point out that this is not something to celebrate.  If anything, it is a disaster and reveals one of the weaknesses of the democratic system.  In my opinion, the West has a responsibility (the US especially) to do whatever it can to avoid another Taliban era in Afghanistan.  The fact of the matter is that the Dutch departure solidifies in the minds of every politically savvy Afghan the reality that working with the westerners will be slow suicide, guaranteeing death when they inevitably depart.  And the departure of the US will be horrifically bloody and violent, much more so than the occupation is, as the various elements opposed to the western forces use the opportunity to solidify gains. 
 I fear that the end of this war will look disgustingly like the fall of South Vietnam.  Although largely ignored in the US, the collapse of South Vietnam and the invasion of the North was horrific, and the pictures of people fighting to stay on the helicopters leaving the US embassy to flee the communists is gut wrenching.  The collapse in Afghanistan will be worse.  I guarantee it.  There are not two sides, but two hundred, and the various forces will turn on each other, specifically targeting the civilian support behind their opponents, in an all out brawl to control the last vestiges of the country.  The violence will be staggering, and the destruction even worse than it already is.  It will, of course, be ignored in the West, if only because they could not stand to watch the results of their actions play out. 
 This is the reality I think the citizens of the various democracies involved in the war are ignoring, willfully, because they don't want to face the fact that the only acceptable solution is to make a continual commitment to maintaining Afghanistan right now.  Of course, Europe feels no such responsibility, because they can easily pass it off as the US's war in a pinch, and they're used to the US taking care of all the ""unsavory backwash"" from the former colonies and subjects anyways. (Israel/Palestine, Pakistan/India, Vietnam, etc.)  Heck, Europe doesn't even feel responsible for it's own backyard - the former Yugoslavia - or it's minority populations - violence against Roma populations in Europe, virulent racism against African illegal immigrants, ghetto-ization of Muslim populations, etc. 
 Not that simply sitting around maintaining the status quo will do any good.  There is a plethora of other things that need to be discussed, from replacing vast amounts of the government and military structure to combat corruption, to legal uses of the poppy grown practically everywhere (a discussion France certainly doesn't want to have, seeing as how they control the vast majority of the world morphine market, and competition from Afghanistan would destroy that particular export).

But it's not about the salary, it's all about the taxes! 
 So, image you're working in CH. If you also live in CH, you pay CH tax. If you live in DE, you have to pay 4.5% CH source tax + (DE tax - already paid CH taxes).

 Yes there were civilians killing civilians and there was mass murder but to the best of my knowledge it was the army's and militias doing the mass killings and while certainly absolutely inexcusable, many civilians who ended up on trial for murder plead insanity because they claimed victim was the person who raped and murdered their families. Some or maybe even most of these claims are total BS but others did literary lose their minds after loosing everything else.

They did get the water supply and that was bad plus a few acts of sabotage that still haunt the community but we were spared the neighbor on neighbor violence and got our shit together relatively quickly.

 Libya was attacked because Gaddafi vowed to wipe out an entire city and was clearly going through with it, also America wasn't the sole country involved and it was a UN mandated intervention. In hindsight I doubt they would've done it if it meant that they would be expected to intervene in every uprising by people around the world against every tin pot dictator killing their opponents. Also the groups replacing Gaddafi aren't likely to be much better, it was absolutely a dumb move, but not a sinister plot. 
 
 The last thing 'The West' wants is military intervention in Syria, why do you think the UN was able to successfully intervene in Libya? Because there was a general consensus amongst the international community that Gaddafi was intent on mass killing and Libya's lack of political clout and staunch international defenders made it a viable option to remove him or at least offer some support to the opposition. That is not so with Syria, Russia and Iran have many vested interests and western leaders (discounting some right wing American politicians and some cocky European political figures) DON'T want any more reasons for conflict with Iran or Russia apart from electoral rhetoric (see the Republican party debates, it should be fairly obvious by now that one point the Republicans are going to push when it comes to foreign policy is that they are siding with Israel and Obama is not which is a total crock of shit but many people will buy it).

 It's also about teaching study habits and skills. The actual information gleaned in public school could definitely be more efficiently home-schooled or self-taught, especially in the era of the internet. 
 But as someone who basically ignored high school (skipped a grade, then dropped early to get my GED and go through comm college), these are the things I would have learned in school that were difficult or painful to learn on my own: 
 1: Navigating bureaucracy and satisfying asinine prerequisites/requirements. In the real world, you're going to need to deal with HR. High School gives you a preview of that with school counselors, mandatory pep rallies, and obnoxious forms and pointless rules. If you ignore them, you get reprimanded and put back on course-- not fired or failing to be enrolled in an important class. 
 2: Studying. Something hinted at during my brief stint in a public high school was studying and mandatory homework. The classwork was easy enough that I just ignored the homework, aced the tests, and didn't worry myself about my actual grade because ""What mattered is learning the material"". Turns out that all those waste-of-time methods they tried to force on me in high school were methods I ended up appropriating once I figured out that I would need to actually study in College. I failed Bio 102 twice before I got that through my skull. 
 3: Teachers/Bosses are human beings with flaws that can harm you but also be exploited. Have a bad teacher? That sucks, but you will have a bad boss at some point, and you need to learn how to make the most out of that situation without starting a conflict you will lose.  Is your teacher unaccepting of a particular point of view, even if you support it with sound reason? Welcome to the real world, sometimes you have to learn to keep your mouth shut and give your employer what he wants. Also, having a high school teacher dislike you because you argued that ""Hitler Did Nothing Wrong"" or some such contrarian opinion is far more easily dealt with than a tenured Professor or upper-level manager.","Life and people are mean and illogical, but predictably so. High School has few real life ramifications, so it's an excellent place to learn these foibles without shooting a career in the foot."
worldnews,cesjlfw,"Ethnic Cleansing]( -  the systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory... 
 The writer needs to sit down with a dictionary before using hyperbolic terms like Ethnic Cleansing, which is  not  what is being talked about here. I'm not defending this ""Moldovan"" bouncer, but he's talking about trading control of territory in one area for control of another so that in the future, most Palestinian Arabs will be in ethnically Arab Palestinian state and the Jewish Israeli's in a Jewish state. That way, both can still remain democracies based on the popular vote of the population. He's not suggesting the killing or forced relocation of Palestinians. Far from it. He's suggesting they move the borders to account for the realities on the ground. 
 This is straight out of [US President Wilson's 14 points]( the 14th to be exact: 
 ""A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike."" 
 In plain language, ethnic groups that live in a given area should have political control of that area and be independent; AKA no more Empires. 
 The Palestinian Muslims need their own country and so do the Israeli Jews because they are ethnically, religiously and culturally distinct people in order to protect the minority rights of both. They have different rates of reproduction, the Palestinians rapidly out-reproducing the Israelis at this time, and so to remain viable democracies, they must be separated politically and geographically.","Its about trading who controls what towns and redrawing borders to preserve geographic majorities, not forced relocation."

worldnews,c7rwsch,"Sorry, but are you stoned? I'd first like to point out that the person you quoted notes a 22% of the NATO budget coming from the U.S., with a combined higher GDP than France and Germany (respectively, 15 trillion to 2.8 and 3.7 trillion) by more than double, whereas France and Germany(combined, again) still outspend them - as just mentioned. Secondly, NATO has not been active or necessary for European protection for a long time and would be just fine being defunded in it's entirety if that were the only reason for it's existence, but it is not and you are a complete tool for pretending it is(Much less a gift, as Europe seems to pay more than it's fair share for a military alliance in comparison to GDP per capita by far). 
 Now that your first ludicrous myth is adressed, let's move on to the second complete fabrication: the notion that you stationing troops here is a gift. In fact, America stations troops in a great deal of nations around the globe, more than even America seems to be aware of itself, but none of this is done from the kindness of their hearts. This is what's referred to as ""American interests"", in other words, providing a service to gain political influence, military deployment locations or local resources and what have you. In the case of Europe, it is mostly used for political influence and global power struggling(with America basically posturing by taking a great amount of positions in Europe to, not just ""protect their allies"", but also to let their enemies(especially this) be surrounded at all times by strategic locations). 
 This leads to another point, the ""training opportunities"" and sale of weapons. The training opportunities are, again, a strategic asset to the U.S. for two reasons - number one being that their allies are actually worth having in a fight, which they most certainly are, and serve to reinforce the position of military strength held by the United States. Number two, the sale of weapons is actually forced on a great deal of these governments and simply serves as a bonus profit for the military industrial complex. The arm of that lobby stretches far, much farther than you can imagine, and uses its political sway to force small European nations to buy highly priced American technology. The reasoning for this is blatant and obvious, as the technology would be developed by the United States anyway(as if they would not bid on these contracts with excessive amounts demanded and loaded with porkbarrel - no political representative would have the nerve to appear ""weak on defense"" and he would lose any position he held near immediately) and this is simply a way of recuperating extra costs or increasing profits by growing market share. What's more, the U.S. government is all in favor as this does allow them to pay somewhat less(note: not that much) on military contracts because the required profits do eventually have European and other national sales included in the revenue calculations. 
 You might not know that no one in Europe cares to spend this kind of money on their military, but are often forced to by the U.S. military industrial complex and their extremely powerful lobby under threat of economic consequences(i.e. unfavorable contract bidding for third parties operating in the United States, or simply flat out throwing on trade restrictions, tariffs, import quotas and other sanctions!), or diplomatic loss of status as enforced by the massive political web(with amazing clout) the U.S. weaves.","Europe pays a greater share for NATO than the U.S. does, NATO serves more purposes than the defense of Europe(by far), and everything the U.S. does as far as military expansionism goes is entirely motivated by self interest - often even by force due to the benefit the U.S. sees from these kinds of investments in their ""national interests"".

worldnews,cjwldpg,"This is an edited letter I sent to a news publication earlier to show why the 5% figure is complete bullshit: 
 I can definitely state that Iron Dome's intercept rate is over 5%. 
 Statistics and Analysis 
 First, his analysis is not new and is mainly based on Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, not the most recent conflict, and was done using civilian photographs. (Weirdly, I can't find the original analysis itself, only reports of it.) It is not clear in yours or other articles whether he is stating that only 5% of total rockets, or 5% of rockets that Iron Dome fires at, are intercepted. A clarification would be nice in that respect, since the IDF only fires the Iron Dome when the missiles are headed to a built up area, since it are so expensive to use. 
 Here is Ha'aretz on the 2012 analysis.  Two articles( 1 ,  2 ) in the MIT technology review have been published about this. I believe the article you linked to is based on the second: 
 Here are the latest IDF statistics  of rockets fired at Israel (note: as of 8/05): 
 
 3,360 rockets fired  
 2,303 hit Israel (70%) 
 475 hit gaza (14%)  
 584 intercepted by Iron dome (17%) 
 
 If the IDF claims an 80% success rate of Iron Dome, that means: 
 
 they fired at about 730 (22% of total rockets) 
 and missed 150 (5% of total rockets)  
 Most of the 2000+ rockets that did hit would have hit open areas, but not all. 
 
 5% effectiveness related to total rockets would be 150 intercepted, which is 20% attempted interceptions, nothing to sneeze at though still not great. 5% of attempted interceptions would be only about 40 rockets. Which is it? 
 Refutation 
 Second, His analysis is pretty easy to refute, not by looking at grainy images, but by looking at warnings, damages, and casualties. There have been over 30 sirens in the Tel Aviv area; unlike your article states, most of it is apartment buildings or high rises, not open space. (If you want to see a city with open space, go to Be'ersheva.) As far as I can tell, and I have been following updates closely, there have not been one rocket reported to actually hit the area. How is this possible if Iron Dome only intercepts 5% of the rockets it launches at? The expensive, Iranian made Fajr-5 missiles actually use a targeting system and would be aimed toward civilian populations. 
 And the places further south (Kiryat Melachi, Ashdod, Ashkelon, etc.) seem to have much less damage than they did in the 2008 war. You're the reporter, not me, so this is something you can research, but my impressions were that it was unsafe to at all live in those areas during that war, and there was a lot of destruction. This year, there have been very few reports of damages, while I remember almost every day I heard about rocket damage in 2008 and 2012. 
During this operation there have been only  3 civilian deaths and 22 injuries  (according to the IDFblog which seems to have stopped updating in mid-July, but I can't imagine that it is more than 50 injuries) while in 2008, according to Wikipedia,  600+ were injured  (4,000 rocket attacks) and in 2012 it was  almost 300  (3,000 rocket attacks). This is another place your analysis and/or the professor's fails; yes, the deaths are about the same, but as he says deaths are unlikely anyway. However, injuries and damages are dramatically down while rockets, and more targeted and damaging rockets, are up. This would make no sense if Iron Dome wasn't working.","A 10-20 fold decrease in injuries, and massively reduced reports of damages, is absurd if Iron Dome wasn't successful. 
 Feeling of Security 
 Furthermore, anyone on the ground can tell you there is a large difference between this war and 2008. There is a different sound if a rocket hits the ground, a rocket explodes on the ground, or an Iron Dome intercepts a rocket. There have been multiple reports of shrapnel falling from destroyed rockets. People feel much safer because they notice my points above.  Iron Dome is not a celebrity in Israel because people see it shooting and the IDF publishes statistics, but because they can see that the destruction from Hamas is severely limited now that it has been deployed all across the south. 
 Conspiracy 
 Final point: It would require an incredible conspiracy to cover all of this up (/r/conspiracy levels!). There are lots of people working or have worked on Iron Dome, and they would have to prevent anyone from speaking about its failure. If there has been damages from rockets hitting buildings, like the one that killed 3 in 2012, it would need to be covered up. If there were no rockets fired at the Tel Aviv area, the only other conclusion from my above analysis, then fake Red Alert sirens would have to be ordered and then covered up. None of these are plausible. 
 Is it possible the IDF is exaggerating somewhat? Possibly. But nothing on the order of a 5% of claimed interceptions or of total rockets. We would be seeing entirely different results on the ground if that was the case. 
 Edit: Your points are addressed above as well, but to show specifically why you are wrong: 
 >it has more to do with the crude and shitty rockets being used than the Iron Dome. 
 Then why are damages and injuries down so much if Iron Dome wasn't working? 
 > Also, the thing that keeps Israelis safest isn't the Iron Dome - it's the incredibly effective and well deployed early warning system that allows people to find cover quickly 
 Absolutely. But even with this system over 600 people were injured in 2008, and we are seeing nothing on that level today. Statistics of damages are much harder to find, but it seems to be a lot less as well. 
 >Studies have shown that even a 5 second warning, allowing someone to lie/duck down and cover, increases surivability by 60%+ Makes sense if you think about the explosion and trajectory of debris. 
 Survivability =/ Injuries.  Yes, they might survive, but could still be moderately or severely injured. Your analysis doesn't explain the discrepancy."

 There are two categories of Royal residences: the occupied Royal Palaces and the unoccupied Royal Palaces. 
 The former comprises Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, St. James’s Palace, Kensington Palace (excluding the State Apartments) and Clarence House, and are used by members of the Royal Family and their Households. 
 The latter are no longer used as residences by the Sovereign and comprises Hampton Court, the Tower of London, the State Apartments at Kensington Palace, the Banqueting House at Whitehall, and Kew Palace with Queen Charlotte’s Cottage. 
 Buckingham Palace is not only the London home of The Queen; The Duke of Edinburgh, The Duke of York, The Earl and Countess of Wessex, The Princess Royal and Princess Alexandra also have private offices and apartments located within the Palace.

 I am fine with legalization and taxing, but it's more for liberty reasons than economic reasons. If hard drugs create an epidemic of overuse, maybe then we'll ban them again, but right now it seems like legalizing them won't cause widespread use, and it seems that education and harm prevention is more effective than incarceration with respect to helping people that might develop drug problems. 
 If during the prohibition police  did  find a way to stop criminals from selling alcohol, then would that mean that prohibition would have been a good idea? I don't think so.

worldnews,ccqucxu,"Here's my story: 
 In high school, I was kind of a mess and caused my parents a lot of grief (mostly just anger at them from years of suppressed feelings). When it came time for me to go to college, my dad said that he would take care of getting my student loans for me because it was confusing and he claimed to know what he was doing. 
 I graduated in 4 1/2 years with a 3.79 and two BAs, one in psychology and one in theatre understanding I would need to go to grad school for either one to be successful. I had 525 hours of internship in psychology and a killer resume for theatre on top of working since I was 15 years old. I changed my mind about grad school and decided to look for a job, recognizing that I wouldn't want to get a master's degree in something I wouldn't enjoy or use. Changed jobs a couple times, highest I made was 11.25. 
 My student loans started coming in, and at minimum I'd owe $1,400 a month for them. My debt is at least $117,000 after using my loans to pay for school, transportation, a place to live, and food (the college cost out of that is $80k). At least half of the loans I have are unfixed interest and already at a 10% interest rate. On top of the other bills I have, my cost of living is 2k a month at this point while making $1800 a month before taxes. 
 Recognizing that I'm only making payments on the interest and would be paying this amount for the majority of my life, I chose to get a lawyer and go into litigation to get out of debt. I do not need to make payments at this time and the lawyer's cost is less than half of what my loan payments would be, bringing my bills and cost of living total to affordable. However, there was some serious unethical behavior at the company I was working for and chose to quit. 
 I am currently a stripper and making more than enough to make my payments on time and save money to move to a more economical location with better job prospects. 
 My father is furious, insists I'm living a life of sin, blames me for the debt and all of the financial disarray when it was his idea in the first place, and wants me to move home so I can get a dead-end job in my home town and continue not getting along with my parents due to belief and lifestyle differences (I practice yoga and eat vegetarian). 
 I am happier than I have ever been, dealing with my finances independently of my parents (they stopped helping me when I told them I'm dancing), and my dad can't look at me without seeing only the shame I have brought to him. 
 To those speaking of a revolution forming, I believe one of the principles of my father and I's shitty relationship is that I don't really care about the money aspect of things. I'm looking for something higher than material success, which is why the yoga and eating habits are non-negotiable for me. I could easily drop all of that and listen to what my parents say, but I would be miserable and right back to where I was before I went to college mentally and emotionally.","Became a stripper to pay off my student loans, dad hates me."

In Canada we take drastic steps to make sure that these pipelines are safe, technology isn't going to get worse it is only going to get better.

 >Because when you are stabbed unlike in video games you do not always instantly die. He could have been shot in non vital areas of the body but yet the stab wounds were in vital areas and it was just a matter of time before he died. 
 This is actually a possibility. Just because a wound is  ultimately  mortal does not mean it is  immediately  so. It also does not mean the individual is incapacitated. A wounded, armed individual is still a dangerous individual. Through-shots from a firearm may not have been what killed him, but may have delivered enough force to non-vital areas -- the shoulder(s), leg(s), arm(s), neck and/or stomach -- to incapacitate him. 
 Keep in mind that although a knife generally does more tissue damage, the sheer force of a bullet in the right place can spin a person to the ground and/or break a joint/destroy musculature required for a certain level of locomotion: if the party can no longer walk or use their weapon, they are incapacitated but not yet dead.

 Today Wikileaks has released a state department memo that reportedly contains excerpts from an email Osama bin Laden was supposedly finishing and preparing to save to a flash disk when the US special forces raided his compound and shot him in the head. 
 From the slave of God Osama bin Laden to the people of the countries in alliance with the unjust government of the United States: 
 Greetings to those that have followed the faith. The road to safety starts with lifting aggression and it's fair and right to be treated equally. 
 And that brings me to today's questions:  Should we treat our women as equals?  Should they be allowed to drive cars?  Should they be allowed to get an education?  Should they be forced to wear the hijab or burqa? 
 I have done extensive research lately on the western evil of pornography.  I obtained many movies from various sources and have studied them at length to try to determine for myself the net effect of exposure to pornography and my own lust for the female flesh when more than hands and eyes are exposed. 
 Let me state unequivocally that women in western pornography apparently willingly expose their hair, faces, arms, legs, creamy white thighs, ripped stomachs, ample bosom and even their vulvas.  At first, I was shocked and overly aroused by these sights.  Upon viewing my first porno video, I experienced one with Allah within three seconds of the opening credits at the site of a mouth wearing red lipstick singing a song about a science fiction double feature. 
 However, upon repeated viewing, I eventually was able to view the entire movie, memorizing many of the lines and actually performing some of the dance routines in the movie.  I encouraged others at the compound to view this movie in private at first, and asked them whether, upon repeated viewing, they could view the movie without experiencing arousal.  Eventually, everyone in the compound had viewed the movie with me, all experiencing little titillation, but eventually recognizing how lame the story line for the movie was.  We started having group airings of the movie, and started to curse the characters, lines, and special effects.  We eventually compiled a whole series of counter statements to the movie ... and even dressed as the characters and threw things at the screen. 
 But I digress.  After viewing this initial movie, apparently a western pornographic version of the Rocky movies made by Stallone (whose Rambo II, I enjoyed immensely) and some Frankenstein movie that I have not seen, I requested more arousing movies from my contacts.  They asked if I was ready for the full Monty.  Not knowing what that meant, but confident in Allah's faith in his loyal manservant, I said, ""Sure."" 
 What I was given next was another total shock to my system.  These were the first movies that revealed to me the full extent of those things we are not to see in accordance with the laws of Sharia.  I felt like a sinner, but was reassured that Muslims in western countries find great pleasure in these films.  So, I pressed on with my research. 
 Again, I was confronted with a view of human sexuality that I have only imagined was possible, like if someone walked in on one of my wives and I and mistakenly turned the lights on.  It was all there, and left nothing to the imagination.  My system could not tolerate more than a few minutes of viewing these movies, but with practice, I found I was able to withstand more than 15 minutes of viewing before I needed to sleep. 
 And still, I persisted.  And over these last eight years, I have made an amazing discovery, and now find that I must share this knowledge with my brothers and sisters in adoration of Allah. 
 In the first few years, I must confess, I could not get enough of these movies.  It was like the drug from the poppy plant ... I feared my wanton lust for the women in these movies would drive me insane.  I worked up to nearly eight hours a day of continuous viewing, Allah bless Onan.  But then, after a few years, things started to change.  My lust and desire for these movies seemed to be sated. 
 As I encouraged my wives to view these movies, we began to experiment with the things we saw in them.  We tried to reproduce with the lights on.  At first, it was too much of a shock to the system, so we decided to work our way up, gradually.  We started with candles. 
 Over time, my wives and I grew to feel almost, dare I say it, ""casual"" about our carnal knowledge of one another, and even disrobed in one another's presence.  It was then that I discovered we actually have too much hair, you know, down there.  Shaving did not then seem like a sin, but a necessity, to further my research. 
 Again, I must confess, as progress in my research continued, the sight of a woman's face, hands, buttocks ... became less and less arousing.  My dreams of raping virgins dissipated and eventually were replaced with dreams about strange things that had no relationship to or involvement in human reproduction.  I found that I thought less and less in my waking hours about my lust, and started to reconsider my views on other subjects ... 
 After experiencing the joys of what the westerners call ""reverse cowgirl"", I started to view my wives as equals, and even insisted that I see their faces, hands, arms and legs around the house.  My couriers stated they were not shocked at this development, because they had experienced the same things for themselves in their lives ... doing their own independent research. 
 This led me to question my own religious teachings.  I know it may seem blasphemous to state this, but I started to view those teachings as the writings of a bunch of misogynistic goat-fuckers from more than a millennium ago.  I mean, these people wiped their asses with their left hands and went all day without washing it.  I started to think that maybe we have been following the word of the uneducated, the uninformed, the ignorant. 
 That led me to question my hatred for the west. Over time, I still see the United States as the great Satan in international affairs and all things financial (although, I confess, they are only second to the Swiss when to comes to helping me hide my money), but I have much respect for the hard work that is done in the San Fernando Valley. 
 I know what I am about to say may seem in direct contradiction to my pronouncements of the past, but I honestly think that it is time to call for equal rights for women ... that women should be allowed to service themselves, one another and their men as only they can do, spiritually, intellectually and especially, physically, and without the constraints we have placed upon them and in our laws. 
 I also feel that we can work with the western world and can achieve lasting peace between Muslims and all other religions. 
 That is why I am calling for an end to the requirement of the wearing of the hijab or burqa and even to our entire jih(hold on, there is someone at the door)",Learn how to read and stop downvoting people who write more than once sentence.

It was literally the identical thing as today's news. 
 Guess what changed? Nothing. It was a joke. Every teacher just kept on pushing and pushing, and for good reason too; for all the big talk the education ministry was making, if you want a good life in China and are not born into it, exams will be your only chance at every level, starting from even the  xiaoshengchu  at 6th grade for the really good schools, to the  zhongkao  at 9th grade, to the notorious  gaokao  at 12th. There will be no change whatsoever if those exams are there, and it won't be easy to replace them without facing massive problems.","This whole show today is just a rerun of what happened 10 years ago, and I have a feeling that people know it and will disregard it immediately as such."
worldnews,cr98t94,"The reason why the New world was so susceptible to exploitation by European settlers is because by 1607, native population continent-wide was literally cut in half by European diseases that traveled ahead of the settlers. By the American Revolution, Native population was 80 percent less than 1492 levels. The difference in technology was a factor in the conquests, but when everyone's dying around you, you can't put up much of a concerted resistance of any kind. 
 The reason why Europe had so many pathogens is because they domesticated animals and Native Americans did not have nearly as many. If you live around animals, you are exposed to the diseases they have and a population gets immunity or resistance to these pathogens over time. However, even if Native Americans had domesticated animals of their own as extensively and for as long as Old World societies had, there would be completely different sets of immunities in the  New World  population, which would still have not given them much protection from uniquely European germs. 
 Which leads us to a really interesting (if nightmarish) scenario. 
 If animal domestication had been as much of a practice in the New World as it was in the Old World, it would have been entirely possible for the New World to have spread terrible plagues that  Native Americans  were resistant to to the Old World to  Europeans , resulting in an eventual decimation of  both  populations. Urban living also promotes the proliferation of disease, but while North American societies weren't dense enough to be urbanized extensively, Central and South American empires definitely were.","Epidemology is no joke.

 Small constitutional history lesson: prior to the revolution, one of the things that the revolutionaries was worried about was what are now ""unlawful"" arrests. Anyone could be arrested for anything, and no one had to know about it. 
 The founders (and anti-federalists, the reason why the bill of rights was included) wanted to limit this, hence the 5th amendment.

 I signed onto a new job at a new company who refused to pay for my education because my school to my surprise wasn't regionally accredited.

 Long story, less long I transferred, only a few credits transferred, and my employer took care of most of the rest of my education.

worldnews,cb8x2h8,"In the middle east, throughout much of history, neither gender wore pants (notable exception of horse-riding cultures for obvious reason pants are more practical on a horse). 
 Originally in Rome and Greece neither gender wore pants as they were viewed as barbaric. In the time of the New Testament pants were worn by both genders of Romans who had adopted the clothing once they moved outside of Italy (I guess warm genitals won out over fashion). 
 Throughout the middle ages in Europe and the west, it became less and less common (and eventually taboo) for women to wear pants. 
 In western society these days, honestly, pants are broadly acceptable as clothing for women.","Throughout history pants have not exclusively been men's clothing and skirts/dresses have not been exclusively women's clothing. Regardless, these days pants are fine for women to wear.

worldnews,c9prrdq,"Sorry, I realise you are ranting, but you are incredibly incorrect on the subject of slavery. The British Empire was the entity that ended slavery  first . Prior to it banning slavery in international waters and siezing slave ships and setting the slaves free at the nearest port, there was slave trade internally everywhere, except in England. Anywhere where there was war there were the defeated being captured for slavery. 
 White Slavery is something that a lot of former European colonies like to ignore. From the 16th to the 19th centuries it is estimated that between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and Barbary Slave Traders and sold as slaves during this time period. Barbary pirates were based on that coast of North Africa – what is now Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. 
 Yes it was private British plantation owners and private slave traders that were supplying the American colonies, but the slave trade was considered illegal in England since the outlawing of serfdom in 1381 and had been [proven so in 1772]( In 1773, 1774 and 1775 there were court cases in Massachusetts brought by American slaves against their slave owners for being against English law. Those cases were repeatedly thrown out by the state Governors. So afraid were the Americans of Britain enforcing its common law on America that they rebelled in 1775. 
 The black population in many former atlantic ocean territories such as the Caribbean, and St Helen's was due to the British military ships freeing siezed slave ships at the nearest port (they could not accommodate the slaves back across the ocean so took them to the nearest port, freed them, and sunk the slave ships). 
 Its worth noting the source I provided is a case involving a private American slave owner, and his slave being freed in England.

And Afghanistan is a best case scenario. It was a war thousands of miles away, after a huge terrorist incident. We were killing people who didn't look like your everyday American.

 Milosevic and Hussein also only committed their crimes within the countries they led (or sometimes the countries neighboring them). The Pope's crimes have been going on in countries all over the world, on victims as innocent as they fucking get. I am not making this comparison to say that what the Pope has done is anywhere near as bad as something like genocide, but you wouldn't be hard pressed to produce a list of leaders overthrown (or even assassinated) by western influence for doing far less. 
 Bottom line is that legal immunity is just a term for not taking legal action because it would either cost too much money, or lose too many votes. 
 Priests and bishops, they're pretty much immune too because taking on the Catholic Church is political suicide (hint: it isn't ""convenient"" for lawmakers to go after people who can sway hundreds of millions of votes).

worldnews,cfqttfl,"I went to Jamaica last year with 20 people (part of a wedding) we are all aged 20-35 and most of us probably looked like a wild boy crew 
 My experience entails: 
 I get off at runawaybay headed to resort x (one of the more fancier resorts) 
 Nobody in the airport or on the bus offered to sell us anything, the again by the time we got out of the airport it was 8pm 
 After hearing about how everyone's grandmas could get garbage bags of weed for next to nothing we decided to hunt that very night. 
 Got to the hotel/resort, rushed to the bar, requested a bunch of champ juice bottles and began the quest for ridiculous amount of weed for a ridiculous price. 
 We asked everybody from bellboys to security (we had no idea we were talking to security they just looked like normal resort staff) but we kept coming up short 
 Everyone was mad 'spicious and when we did find someone willing to sell, they wanted $50 for what looked like large branches wrapped in black bags. We got tired of looking and decided to haggle the shit out of a Jamaican guy and got about a quart for $15. 
 Fast forward a day we made friends with the resort Dj, through his friend who was an excursion planner of same resort, she linked us to this other guy she knew who ran a cab. He decides to take us 45 mins out into the country for $50 to the ""plantations"". 
 We were so excited to finally be able to see Jamaica outside of the resort and above all, see the holy grail, a plantation of weed 
 Guy scammed us when he basically took us bum fuck nowhere to some village, roll up to the front ""entrance"", we past by this booth where a bunch of half naked Jamaicans were busy cutting /chopping weed in plain site, fast forward a bit some other Jamaican dude leads us to his backyard, shows us his ""plantation"". 
 Bodmon dude goes off about how he has white widow Kush this, blue berry Kush that, the plants looked like they were not ready for picking but after the short 3 min tour he asks us what we want. I tell him I want enough to fill 3 Herschel back packs (we had 3 bags on us) to the brim, Jamaican bodmon dude laughs and asks if we were trying to start a drug gang ourselves (?????) anyway bodmon dude goes somewhere comes back with ""2kilos"" worth, it was certainly way more than anyone in Jamaica has ever had with him or offered us but I'll be a donkeys left nut if that was 2 kilos worth. Dude goes $900 for the entirety.

 In Africa, there is violence, death and torture far worse than

 extent we have in Iraq?

 the way we think is because the world and history are incredibly 
 complex systems, and stepping in and meddling in that system can 
 have disastrous consequences worse than the problem we tried to

 For example, the modern country of Iraq is a British creation carved from the carcass of the Ottoman Empire after its defeat in WWI, with border lines drawn arbitrarily at a negotiating table between the victorious Allied Powers that did not take into consideration the reality on the ground, only the advantage of the colonial power. Putting together Kurds, Sunni and Shi'a who have been fighting each other for centuries in one country. The British tried to bring peace to that mess, and were eventually forced out (and ironically, they are back - I guess Tony Blair did not pay enough attention in history class). The British installed one despot, which lead to another despot, which finally lead to Saddam. Why is there so much violence in Iraq today? Because all of these people are fighting each other, Shia vs Sunni, Kurds vs everyone else, one religious militia fighting another. Saddam was a bastard, but through an extremely bloody iron fist, he kept that mess in check, possibly preventing even worse bloodshed. Like we are haphazardly doing today. We inherited a godawful mess that we will unlikely be able to fix, and when we eventually leave, like the British did, the country will descend into chaos until the next Saddam comes to power.

worldnews,c8w8bkg,"I'm going to try to not get heated about this but this thought process behind they aren't trying to find a cure for cancer or its hidden away somewhere is such outright and utter bullshit. 
 I'll start by saying because of the very nature of the disease, there will NEVER be a single, ubiquitous cure for cancer.  It manifests from so many different places in genetic errors, misfolded and deregulated proteins that anybody who thinks there ever will be just one cure is outright delusional.  Trying to pin it down with one drug is about as close to impossible as it gets, the disease is much much too dynamic for that.  I mean there are times that an individual is undergoing successful therapy with one drug and then without warning the cancerous cells will become resistant through mutations and render that drug completely useless. 
 Often times even when you do beat back cancer you are bound to get it again simply because your cells are genetically predisposed or you've been exposed to some kind of carcinogen that has caused mutations that you can't get rid of. 
 Dream scenario, a lab finds a ubiquitous cure for cancer, makes it through the FDA, gets into the market.  That is a $125 billion dollar market that they have the corner on right out of the gate.  To give you an idea of what kind of money that is, J&J the largest pharmaceutical in the world by revenues, pulls in roughly $60b/year.  Now not only have you alone cornered a market that is twice the size of the largest pharma's revenue, but you have effectively knocked everybody else out of that market for the foreseeable future.  Avastin,  a $6b dollar/year drug (top selling oncology drug globally), revenues gone for genentech/roche.  Every other pharmaceutical is small potatoes to you now.  You have the ability to outspend any other company by two-fold and can use that cash to build an immensely diverse and robust pipeline catapulting you to the forefront for decades to come. And that is my first point, I'm no business major but not releasing your drug sounds like some pretty fucking bad business if its not only giving you a chance to utterly destroy your competition, but also develop your own products for the future with more money than god. 
 But what now you say?  I cured cancer, made my $125b dollars, my scientists and lowly research associates that TOOOTALLY didn't want to cure cancer (because, you know, they don't have any skin in the game in stock options or anything) were all made millionaires overnight when our drug hit the market.  BUT NOW THERE'S NOBODY LEFT TO GIVE OUR DRUG TOO!  And then you realize that that is the stupidest fucking argument you've ever heard. Kids, first time patients and all those people who beat it back before but are genetically predisposed are all still getting fucking cancer!  The revenue stream doesn't just magically dry up, who knew?!  Cancer isn't like polio or smallpox, you can't just eradicate it.  It is a disease developed within the body that can arise from the very nature of what keeps you alive. 
 Not only that, but since the FDA won't approve drugs that are not proven to be more effective (along with some other criteria) than the current best in class therapy (and id say curing a disease is pretty fucking effective) you get to keep your outrageous market share until you hit the patent cliff.  Which by then your pockets are so fat that you don't even give a shit about letting it go off the cliff.  Who cares, you'll look like even more of a humanitarian than the cancer curer you already are.  And lets not forget that you've already largely squashed your big pharma competition.  If you weren't savvy enough to maneuver yourself in the market and develop a robust pipeline in that time than I'm gonna guess you weren't savvy enough to cure cancer in the first place. 
 And that my friend, is why nobody is going to sit on the goddamn cure for cancer.  Revenue streams don't dry up like people assume they do when a cure comes out.  There are always going to be people who need that cure.  Shit, even if you make a drug safe enough that everybody just takes it and they never get cancer they still need to take the fucking drug. 
 And this crock of shit that companies don't spend on cancer R&D is ridiculous.  Oncology R&D represented 23% of global R&D costs in 2010 and that number, unlike other spending, has actually held fairly steady to this day.  But I can hear it already, ""23% that isnt even a quarter"" I can assure you that putting 23% of your eggs into one basket is pretty intense when there are a lot of easier diseases to work on. You know like diseases that don't fucking shape shift halfway through your treatment.  I won't lie to you, I'm not even going to bother looking up how much money they put into hair regrowth treatments because I can assure you it is fucking miniscule in comparison. 
 In conclusion, you and people like you need to stop spewing this unfounded bullshit that nobody wants to cure cancer or that a cure is sitting on the shelf in some dark room. It doesn't make sense monetarily or scientifically.  So in that sense you're right, no, a cancer cure won't be the next blockbuster drug.  But you are completely up your own ass that the reason why that is true is because it's more profitable to keep treating people for months.",Curing cancer is still plenty profitable.

worldnews,c8ha5cr,"There are two major issues with the F-35 program, ignoring the technical aspects, which I'm not really qualified to comment on. 
 First, partner nations are inevitable going to reduce their orders for F-35's. Most major partners are European NATO allies. All of them are going through serious defense austerity, with more to come. Couple that with weakness in the European economy and signs of a further slowdown, and, well, the Pentagon needs to (and probably is) planning for the Europeans to cut back on procurement. Of the other partners, as the article pointed out, Australia and Canada are considering cutting back. That leaves Turkey, who wasn't planning on buying many anyways, and not until 2016 (unless the date changed since I last read, which is entirely possible). That leaves Israel, who  need  the F-35 to sustain their aerial dominance that is the cornerstone of Israeli military doctrine. That said, US aid will pay for a lot of Israeli procurement anyways, and they want a special version that isn't likely to bring down general cost. 
 Second, this program is  old . Joint Strike Fighter, JSF, which is where this program originated, began in 1996. That was a different world- a pre-9/11 world, before our new pivot to ""the Pacific"" (read that as China whenever you see it), before austerity, before the rise of the drones. Drones have been sexified by the media lately, but they  are  the future. Drones have the same benefits as unmanned spacecraft and probes- when you don't have to support human life, you can make it lighter, faster, and cheaper. You can use it for more dangerous operations (like flying in Pakistani airspace) because the cost of losing one, in financial and human terms, is relatively cheap. Stealth isn't as much of a factor. Training operators is simpler and faster. Drones are going to become a zerg-like tool. We'll just spam them out in mass quantity. 
 The long and short of this is that the F-35 is symbolic of the problem with our modern military-industrial complex. It's still predicated on preparing for wars that won't happen- mass conflict between powerful state actors. It hasn't adapted, not enough anyways. But it has such powerful political influence via lobbying and its stranglehold over the economy that I don't see much change coming anytime soon.

worldnews,cciu555,"Historically, up until about Reagan's second election the majority of Republicans have been centrist or just right of centrist.  This isn't to say there weren't some conservative elements, but they were less than half of the Republican party. 
 Today, there are still a lot of Senior Republicans left who are from the tail end of that era.  There are some in the house, but most of them are senators.  There has been a lot of push from many Senior Republicans to get something passed in the House, but Boehner, who was a Junior Congressman during the last shutdown, doesn't have the leadership skills to rein the Tea Partiers in. 
 Boehner also doesn't have the platform.  The Tea Party conservatives went into this knowing that they'd get a shutdown, and they know because of their solid footing thanks to their redistricting, that the Republicans who will suffer in the coming elections will be the ones who aren't as far right as they are.  This gives them a chance to put competing Republican candidates on some of those tickets, perhaps increasing their foothold in congress. 
 Its an incredibly risky concept.  They risk actually damaging the country into a state that could be largely unrepairable for many years.  They didn't count on is the Senate holding their ground has hard as they did; the Senate, by delaying the vote until Monday, was able to put the blame right on the shoulders of the House, which I think was largely unexpected by many of the Tea Partiers.  Many of the Tea Party congressmen are still juniors, and they have a twisted idea of how politics works.  The fact that they gave the Senate that opportunity clearly shows just how inexperienced they really are. 
 They've also quite possibly hurt the Republican party as a whole for the long term.  What Boehner, McCain, and other Senior Republicans know is that the last shutdown (which they were all a part of) destroyed their party in the polls for subsequent elections.  The only thing that gave them a decent footing in the end was the Lewinsky stuff in Clinton's second term.  It is very unlikely that they will have something similar this time around, as the Democrats have learned their lesson. 
 So,","Ted Cruz and other Tea Party Republicans have, through crafty redistricting and marketing, managed to put the Republican party into a situation that is quite likely unrecoverable based on their inexperienced understanding of how these politics work."

worldnews,c5v547q,"The $2 trillion is going towards driving interest rates down so Americans can start borrowing and spending again. But low interest rates are  not  an environment where banks can make money. Not sure if you've followed the markets at all over the past few years, but financials are severely underperforming relative to the broader S&P500 index. 
 Or just look at a chart of the return on equity for the big banks. For example, Goldman was making 33% ROE before the recession. Now it's barely making a 5% return: 
 To say that banks are benefiting from this environment is at best uninformed, and at worst asinine. 
 The real reason (besides helping Americans (re)mortgage/(re)finance houses/cars and inflate yet another bubble) behind these low interest rates is for the government to postone its day of reckoning with regards to the massive budget deficit. As soon as interest rates go up and the Treasury has to start rolling $16 trillion of low interest debt to more expensive debt, this country is in a world of trouble. If we end up in a hyperinflation environment (which is very likely), the armageddon that this country will experience will make Greece/Iceland/Ireland/Spain/Italy seem like the minor leagues.","Banks are not benefiting from this interest-free environment. Instead, the government is benefiting (and to a lesser extent, average American taxpayers). Using banks as a scapegoat for all economic problems is very dangerous because you're being distracted from the  massive  and  unsustainable  level of debt the government is running up that  will  eventually lead to financial Armageddon.

 This man suffered through so much because he got injured in a war, a war that he went to because he signed up to join the army, and he did that because a group of religious bigoted terrorists attacked us on our soil.  Yet it even says on the article that he signed up after he saw (the then) president Bush over the wreckage.  Seeing your President over at the aftermath of some sort of attack can give you a very patriotic feeling.  One that could get people into the mentality of ""I'll do my part for this country"". That ""part"" could be anything for someone.  So now he went to sign up for the military to fight the people responsible...oh wait you just got sent to another country to fight people who had nothing to do with the attack in the first place.  So now your motivation to help your country is down because you're not even fighting the people that were responsible for that attack (or any of their allies really).  Yet you hear that they may have WMDs so despite your motivation decresaing already you stay....only to find out years later that there were no WMDs found and there was no serious indication in the first place. 
 So you sign up to go to war against people that attack you only to not fight the people you intended to fight but fight people who had nothing to do with what happened, over nothing (based on what you definitively know).  AND you suffered serious injuries as a result of a war you intended to not fight in the first place 
 Essentially, what I am saying is that I would agree with you if this man had fought Al Queda but due to the fact that he got his injuries fighting in Iraq, and not even the people who attacked us, I can see why he would be pissed off at the man who sent him there

Your best friend (who's father used to be a cop that had trouble catching a robber named Ben), tells you that Ben did it, you go to confront Ben (who you take note looks nothing like any of the thieves), you and Ben get into a fight, you beat Ben and send him to jail for his crimes but you just suffered some sort of very serious head injury from him that can never be fixed and will make your life very difficult to live.  You find out that Ben didn't even have anything to do with your wife's serious injuries.  Wouldn't you be pissed off at your friend for intentionally giving you the wrong information about who attacked your wife?","Signed up to fight people who attacked us, got seriously injured fighting a different group of people.....wouldn't you be pissed off at your president if all your injuries were all for nothing?"
worldnews,clo521y,"For the record, I am in Acapulco every couple of months, and have a number of ties there, both in and outside the city. 
I have been going there throughout all this bullshit going on in the past 7 years. 
 That stat really does not tell you the truth.  Acapulco has seen some shit the past 7 years.  I have experienced some of it personally.  Is it not as safe as NYC, or many cities here.  But honestly?  I felt more scared living in Washington DC in the '90s, or in Newark around the same time. 
 I am not denying the stats.  There was a problem when things went haywire within the Beltran Leyva Cartel.  Power vacuum, fragmenting parts, and then a forays into the city by other cartels.  And for a while, there was a bit of surreal (to someone from NYC) feel to seeing the Army convoys patrolling the streets. 
 The biggest issues plaguing Acapulco (ignoring the usual endemic corruption) were not the murders themselves, but the results of those murders - tourism, especially foreign tourism, fell of a cliff.   Acapulco does not have much other reason to exists, economically.  It is a shipping port, but not nearly as big as others.  So you have a big downturn in their main industry, and in upswing in criminal activity. 
 The extortion was the real killer for Acapulco.  Competing groups would target the same places.  A lot of these places struggled.  And at its peak, when the locals did stay home at night, etc., a lot of businesses just collapsed. 
 That was then, this is now.  Acapulco is definitively safer than it was, though that is not completely because of the government.  Carlos Slim is leading the charge in investing in real estate, and beautification projects.  There are new infrastructure projects happening (though at a frustratingly slow place).

 For one thing, the easy equation between pro-western, secular, etc and being an advanced, civilized state. Having bikinis is the ultimate sign of civilization now? (and while we're at it, did he really praise British colonialism?) 
 Also, while it is hinted at in the article, his way of life (and also mine and my family's) was not the norm, and was only accessible to a narrow slice of people. Part of the reason why Islamic ideology took root and became popular in the middle east is precisely  because of that huge socioeconomic gap, and the Islamic promises of bringing a better society to all. If you want an idea of what that's like, think of latin america (at least before all the leftist gov'ts they've been getting recently that are promising some redistribution). So yeah, those days of bikinis and Beatles were a lot like the gilded age:a few lived it up, the vast majority lived like peasants. 
 But, what's probably the biggest problem with this article, is the complete avoidance of taking on what could be seen as real grievances those big bad Islamists might actually have. For example, the aforementioned social failure (a few rich, the most poor) can be used by the wahabis as an example of the fundamental failure of western culture. Also, the fact that there were US troops all over the Arabian peninsula (or, the land of the two holiest places, as they call it) after the gulf war, going around like they own the place (for example, american women in Saudi Arabia generally didn't wear the hijab to cover their hair, something that all the locals did), something seen as a grave insult to Islam.

worldnews,c62wfxv,"Do you people all have the memory of a FRUITFLY? You cannot seriously be asking for the US to abandon Israel. The stupidity of that notion is only eclipsed by the assumption that it's the Teabagger's Christian claptrap that forms the basis of this alliance (nothing could be further from the truth). 
To elaborate: The purpose of the US-Israeli alliance was (then) the defence of the newly established republic of Israel against ALL its neighbours, ALL of which had sworn pretty much from the get-go to annihilate that state. This is against the backdrop of the holocaust occuring in my home country (I'm German, before you start accusing me of bias). Israel was one of the ONLY places in the world where a Jew could live without hatred, exclusion or downright elimination. 
Israel has been a faithful ally for the US ever since then, providing (among other things) the necessary leverage for the US to start pursuing their geopolitical interests re Saudi Arabia et al in earnest (whether you think that's ethical or not, it is a benefit for the US). 
Israel has also been, during most of its existence, a free and democratic country that by and large sees itself in a European tradition of government. In contrast, all of the surrounding countries are either military dictatorships, kingdoms, or theocracy. Freedom to vote/ of press, gender equality and freedom to pursue your faith are all but illusions in the middle east ANYWHERE outside of Israel. 
""Yes, but Palestine!"", you will interject. Absolutely, the Israeli's treatment of this issue has been terrible, although even for those atrocitities there are deep historic reasons, though no justifications (the Zionist movement in Eastern Europe of the 30's and the bungled hand-over of the ex-British colony of Palestine stick out). You should, however, never forget that the Palestinians are being used by BOTH sides- states like Iran and Saudi-Arabia must pray to the heavens every day that this situation does not change, as it provides a convenient cover for them to resist any serious political reform, and a scapegoat (""we'd all be having ice-cream every day if it weren't for the Judeo-American conspiracy to kill all Muslims!""). Read up on just how little those ""helpers"" of Palestine really do for the people, except for training them for terror and providing them with weapons of course. 
Is Scharon a terrible person, and the whole Israeli govt currently super-right-wing? Again, absolutely yes, Israel has had serious internal problems ever since Jhizak Rabin got shot (a moment I will never forget; peace in the middle East died that day). But is that sufficient to abandon that country? Should the world have abandoned the US in the wake of 9/11 just because you happened to have elected a retarded president (twice)? Of course not. 
Finally, what exactly do you think the effect of abandoning Israel is going to be- that Scharon sits down and goes ""Whoops, we were being bastards, we'll play nice now""? I can tell you what. War. Almost immediately Syria, Iran and possibly Lebanon and Saudi will attack. Israel will retaliate with nukes to Teheran at least, again almost immediately. Makes the world a WHOLE lot safer, right? 
If you want to maintain your influence on someone, you gotta stay his mate, even if he's a dick. Otherwise he won't listen. 
And finally: We SHOULD bomb Iran's missile program. I for one am disappointed the US aren't in the boat with it, though given the overexertion of your military it's understandable. I still hope Israel bombs the FUCK out of Iran though- unfortunately, hope for peaceful reform was shut down in Iran last summer when the green revolution there failed.","Y'all need to learn some history.

worldnews,cak5xga,"Each extradition request must be handled on an individual basis, and it must process through the courts before the government has the ability to exercise a veto. 
 This isn't strictly right. 
 Extradition treaties aren't vague or general. Either the principle of dual criminality applies (the crimes are parallel in both jurisdictions), or there's a list of extraditable crimes in the treaty which are parallel in both jurisdictions. 
 All crimes are territorial, with the exceptions of piracy (the ocean kind not the copyright kind), slavery, and crimes against peace/humanity. Territoriality means that crimes can only be prosecuted in the country they were committed. 
 Here in the US, the government cannot request extradition absent a treaty. The government also cannot extradite a US citizen to a foreign jurisdiction unless a treaty provides for it. 
 Then there's the political offense exception, which is read into every extradition treaty. The political offense exception basically says that a country will not extradite someone for political offenses against the requesting country - i.e. sedition (speaking against the government) or treason (trying to overthrow the government). 
 Countries can also always consent to extradite on request, but that's not what's going on here because Sweden itself has extradition rules of its own: 
 As far as anyone has shown me, American authorities have not charged or expressed interest in charging Julian Assange with a single thing. All I've ever seen are conspiracy theories that the Americans are out to get him when it isn't also clear that Assange has broken any American laws. If someone could point me to a federal statute Assange broke, I'd love to see it. 
 This is what Sweden requires [for extradition]( 
 > ... [extradition requires an offence punishable under the law of both countries (""dual criminality"") that, in principle, is of a certain degree of seriousness.]  Extradition is permitted, provided that the act for which extradition is requested is equivalent to a crime that is punishable under Swedish law by imprisonment for at least one year . If sentence has been passed in the state applying for extradition, the penalty must be imprisonment for at least four months or other institutional detention for an equivalent period. 
 Unpopular as it is to say this, Assange is milking the public's misunderstanding of extradition law for sympathy points and to distract the public of the sexual assault charge against him in Sweden. 
 Think about it - he was in the United Kingdom for months. If  anyone  was going to extradite him to the United States, it would be Her Majesty's Government. 
 But the UK didn't extradite him. Because the Americans didn't ask them to. If the Americans wanted Assange, they'd have asked for him while he was in British hands.","Assange isn't afraid of being extradited to the US. He's afraid of the sexual assault charge in Sweden.

 Let me give you a little lesson on unintended consequences. 
 Why did all of this stuff happen all of a sudden? I mean, bankers didn't just wake up and start making loans to people who couldn't afford to repay them, right? How could they make any money on that? Never really worked in the past. Why now? Why on such a scale? Well, cheap money is created by central banks. It has to flow somewhere. We saw it inflate a dot-com bubble in 2000. It's hard to tell where it will go, but cheap money does not enter the economy evenly across all sectors, it creates bubbles. This time, it was housing. Couple this with government sponsored enterprises (AKA Government doing that which it is not constitutionally authorized to do) in an attempt to get everyone to own a home, and you've got problems. 
 You see, if banks can make bad loans and then pass them off to Fannie Mae and Freddy Mack, then they get to make money up front, and pass all of the risk onto these agencies (which will be propped up by the tax payer, should they inevitably fail). This moral hazard, coupled with easy money created a perfect storm that royally fucked the world economy. 
 So this idea of social engineering is a bureaucrat's wet dream. They get to help the poor (not really), buy votes, get financed, blame capitalism, and then when the shit hits the fan they can offer a solution (always to give themselves more power).",Easy money plus letting banks make profitable loans to unqualified buyers without any risk to themselves fucked the economy.

In doing so, he fulfilled Jewish ceremonial law by embodying everything the law's types and symbols point to. 
 Matthew 5:18 reaffirms the inerrancy and absolute authority of the Old Testament as the word of God. AKA, the prior discussion about the New Covenant rendering the Old Testament inapplicable was incorrect. Rather, Christians simply no longer have to follow the ceremonial elements of the Law, as they have been fulfilled. 
 The Old Covenant provided for works-based salvation. By my (admittedly incomplete) understanding, its avenues for salvation were 1) live a perfect life without breaching the law, or 2) make the sacrifices demanded by God, which symbolized the coming Messiah (EG, sacrificing a lamb for the forgiveness of sins). 
 The New Covenant, on the other hand, is reflected in Matthew 5:20 (see: above), where Jesus says ""unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means enter the Kingdom of Heaven."" This basically sets an insurmountable standard for works-based salvation (because no human can live a perfect life according to the law, see: Isaiah 64:6), the point of which is to clarify that the forgiveness of sins by Christ's sacrifice on the cross is the sole route to heaven. That is the New Covenant crystallized: no more ceremonies, only belief in Christ is the path to heaven.","Christians aren't free of Old Testament law. But it is certainly amended by Christ's word. Specifically Mark 12:28-31: 
 >^^28 One of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, “What commandment is the foremost of all?” ^^29 Jesus answered, “The foremost is, ‘HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD; ^^30 AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH.’ ^^31 “The second is this, ‘YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” 
 ""There is no commandment greater than these"" makes it immensely clear that WBC are totally off the mark. Even better the ""love"" in that verse in the original Greek is ""Ἀγαπήσεις"" or ""agape,"" which is a selfless, sacrificial, unconditional love. The New King James version translated it as ""charity."" Now, I can imagine perfectly how WBC can misconstrue their actions to meet every attempted translation of ""love,"" but the conduct of Jesus should fill in the gaps--he befriended and treated kindly lepers, whores, and the lowest of the low in the society of his day. The contrast should demonstrate that WBC are totally out of line."

No one has ever observed bacteria incorporating new DNA from the digestive system under controlled laboratory conditions. The two types of antibiotic resistance genes used by biotechnologists are ones that already exist in bacteria in nature so the process would not introduce new antibiotic resistance to bacteria.

 Russia was never going to join the missile shield, and if you ask me, inviting them to do so was a sly move since it was obvious from the start they wouldn't join and their declination would—in the public eye—make them look even more intransigent that they already are on such things. 
 Targeting missiles is a long cry from threatening war, too, since it's one of the only things they're useful for. It happens all the time, but the rarity is a state actually informing its opponent  what  exactly they're targeting. The most important thing is that the missile activity was always to be expected. China threatened exactly the same thing when a missile shield was proposed that would surround it—it would massively increase its number of missiles so as to overwhelm the shield.

The Economist article wasn't offering apologetics at all, simply a balanced picture.  The article itself mentioned the overtime that exceeds the hours allowed by Chinese law. 
 I do believe that workers around the world are entitled to exact same benefits as the worker doing the same work in the most advanced countries is allowed.  I consider myself, however, to be a realist in this respect.  China has created a huge middle class in recent decades thanks to foreign investment.  Without the low living standards that would allow such low wages for Western companies, foreign capital would not look to China for cheap labor and promote its economic growth. 
 It's not fair, but it's reality.  With jobs like this, the net income and standard of living has improved for all Chinese.  Chinese people don't starve to death. 
 To immediately demand the same benefits and wages as Western laborers, the Chinese would completely crash their economy.  The sad truth is that, in a large part, global capitalism sustains itself upon inequality.  Another sad truth: there's no easy way around this.  State planning has proven itself inefficient, and at time, unable to provide for the majority of the people.  Markets have, to different degrees, proven themselves to be the most efficient way to distribute goods and services.  With all do respect, your view is incredibly naive.

I cannot sit her and claim to understand the Chinese psyche, since I am not Chinese, but I will tell, from the Chinese I have talked to about this subject, and from books I have, many Chinese are completely comfortable with sacrificing vague Western values of liberal democracy for the economic growth that has made their lives exponentially better than those of their parents and their grandparents. 
 Read about Chinese history.  From the late 1800s to the 1950s, China was (arguably) one of the most culturally, politically, and economically backwards places on Earth.  The Communist Revolution in China brought about impressive economic growth, a certain degree of economic organization, curbed many regressive cultural practices, and reestablished China's position in East Asia. It was also accompanied, however, with two or three decades (depending on how you look at it) of political chaos, mismanagement, and terrible atrocities.   Considering this recent past, it's easy to imagine why Chinese people (in the mainland) will often shy away from politics and embrace the economic growth the Party has proven itself to provide.

worldnews,c17o2m6,"I have a problem with the whole 'withdrawal of consent"" thing. Not because women (and men) don't have the right and ability to stop consenting to sex, because they do. The problem stems from the statement (that is almost always made) ""if you don't stop as soon as they withdrawal consent, then its rape."" Here is my problem; 
 1)Rape is a serious crime, with serious social stigmas attached to it. Attaching the label to someone who did not intend to force someone to have, or continue having sex has serious moral and practical issues. 
 2) Rape is a crime that requires intent. Mens Rea is a critical concept in criminal law, and not one that is any less important in the specific case of rape. 
 3) How long between him/her saying ""stop"" and the cessation of sexual contact is acceptable? Presumably there is a penis (or other appendage) inside some orifice, so some delay is physically necessary. Is it morally and legally acceptable to complete the current stroke before removal? Can you stop and ask for clarification before stopping? (eg: a-""stop"" b-""what? do you want me to stop"" a-""yes!"" b-""ok"") 
 4)What happens if the partner does not realize that consent has been withdrawn? It seems cut and dry, but there are situations where a sudden (and unusual) switch to non-consent is not communicated clearly, or the partner is not able to perceive the withdrawal of consent so it takes longer for a partner to stop.  In such a case, is it still rape? (Eg: a deaf person is having sex, and is verbally told to stop. It takes a few seconds for the partner to try to push the deaf partner off. Has the deaf person just committed rape because they were unable to perceive the verbal command to stop?) 
 By 1, it is unacceptable to label those innocent of the crime of rape as guilty. It is better that every truly guilty man go free than even one innocent man be convicted falsely. This is one of the pillars of western justice systems. By 2 there  must  be some element of leeway between notice and stopping before it becomes rape, otherwise it is clear that there is no intent to continue in the face of withdrawn consent. 3 is essentially a modifier to 2, attempting to clarify the degree and speed at which someone is expected to respond. 4 mandates not only that there be a removal of consent, but a reception of the removal of consent, as a requirement for the satisfaction of 2. The problem in court is showing that the accused actually knew about the withdrawal of consent and continued in the face of said withdrawal. 
 And all that, without even going into what exactly the limits of consent are, and how it must be given or revoked. 
 At this point, I would like to again clarify that both (or all, in some cases) parties to a sexual act have the ability and right to stop the encounter at any point, including before or at any point during the event. To engage in sexual acts without consent is sexual assault.","We are not a race of perfect telepaths, so we can not react to the withdrawal of consent instantly.

 I notice you do not mention that the lead political journalists for 7, 9 and 10 are all firmly in the ALP side of the political landscape. Mark Riley verballed the then opposition leader in a politically motivated and coordinated attack with information supplied by Bruce Hawker who is an ALP media manager (well was until their pathetic effort in the last election) deliberately taking a comment and presenting out of context when referring to the military. Every journalist leapt on this as an error by Abbott but then as the story was cleared up it showed a completely different position. Malcolm Farr and Laurie Oakes have always been friends of Labor and the ABC is a far left organisation who chose to believe the word of an illegal immigrant over the Australian Navy in a story that never would have passed the smell test if a reasonable journalist was running with the story. 
 Australian media is generally of the left, the ABC that you mention is a publicly funded organisation has radio nation wide, television nationwide and it has many online presences that are firmly green/alp aligned. No opponent of the ABC is allowed a dominant ownership position in other markets and all their opposition has to produce a commercial product that would fail in the market if it was as bad as you believe. 
 When those below have complained about the ""bias"" in the media against the ALP in the last election, you can be sure that the stories, such as the Thompson affair.

The ALP and many in the media protected him for three years, purely for the political expediency of him maintaining a seat that would have brought down the Gillard government. 
 Gillard herself, was and is still under investigation for a small matter of defrauding the AWU (Australian Workers Union) by enabling her then boyfriend to set up an entity known as the AWUWRA, a fund that was used in two states to syphon money from businesses under the impression that it was related to the AWU (it was not). She even had two journalists removed from their jobs for having the temerity to investigate this. 
 Last election, the Murdoch newspapers (35%) of the market were firmly for a change in government. policies had failed, policy looked be be being made on the run, major investments such as the NBN were being run by persons under investigation for questionable activities, and we had had over 1200 deaths from asylum seekers (reported, but a statement by the guy thrown in by the Union to try and stem the damage at the election then PM Rudd as 14% which would have actually meant more than 4000) after the ALP changed the border law policies that had seen 3 boats a year an no deaths.

Ed Miliband (the leader of the labour opposition) who is unusual in the UK because he is actually a second generation Jewish descendent (there are very few UK Jews, and they make up less than 0.5% of the population, whereas Muslims make up 5%) came out yesterday publically deploring Israeli action in Gaza. 
 Historically the UK hasn't been particularly friendly to Jews either. Infact they were expelled from the Country until being emancipated in the 1820s. There was also a law called  ""the Statutum De Judaismo""  which compelled them to wear special dress and banned them from most government institutions. In 1905 the UK passed the Aliens Act which made immigration to the UK very difficult for Jews, and even in the build up to and during the second world war the UK kept its borders closed to the Jewish diaspora. Just about the only thing the UK ever did for the Jews was the British Mandate for Palestine, which the Jews ultimately rebelled against leading to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war which effectively established Israel as a credible state.","In the UK Jews have significantly less political clout than they have in the US, as they don't have access to the same kind of lobbying network here - and there numbers are significantly smaller. In addition, the presence of a significant minority of muslims means its often politically more advantageous to be critical of Israel."

worldnews,c9afo43,"Actually, one of the largest problems with the U.S. school system is that it was run state by state until 1980 and shortly there-after, George Bush Jr came in and mucked everything up by selling education. This is one battle that states rights actually won. We saw huge impacts this had on children's education (mainly that rich places were educated very well and poor places were educated very poorly) because it was decided to not distribute any wealth beyond where it is accumulated. 
 This movement in our education system was mainly brought about by its social implications, namely that there need to be different classes of people to do different kinds of work. There need to be poor places, and there need to be rich places to create people who do these different kinds of work. We're the only developed nation not to have a well put together centralized school system.

worldnews,cluvhoq,"Reddit has this massive internalized belief that everything related to Germany and German labor practices is awesome. A great deal of that is actually true, and I'm not interested in arguing that it isn't, but I also don't want to see people get carried away to the point of magical thinking. 
 Let's look at France, Germany, and the U.S. here , because [these are actually the top countries for worker productivity]( -- or are they? [There are different ways to measure]( worker productivity, and in a lot of metrics the U.S. only gets topped by microstates like Luxembourg/Singapore or petrostates like Norway. As with everything else related to economic figures, banking and oil fuck up everything they touch, and when you try to adjust for this the [U.S. reliably beats everyone in Europe]( That's actually a pretty bizarre state of affairs for a country with 316 million people, and I maintain that Reddit collectively has no idea just how much the U.S. is a massive outlier in every set of statistics you can name. 
 Anyway!  /u/gefilte_ghoti is absolutely correct; lengthy vacations for workers make it a real pain in the ass to deal with European companies . When you're doing business with the French, you can kiss all of August goodbye because nobody's there. That was actually a massive factor behind the near-15,000 deaths in [the 2003 European heat wave]( Tons of French families and government ministry workers went on vacation in August at the height of it and didn't bother to check on  grand-mère  in the interim. The fucking  Health Minister  was on vacation and refused to come back. The government as a whole thought the 35-hour work week was so sacred that nobody should ask doctors and nurses to stay longer to take care of people ringing up the hospitals for help, or help track down the elderly with whom family had lost contact, or even to notify next-of-kin when the bodies started piling up in the Parisian morgues. Having an inflexible approach to vacation and work hours means your society's probably not that good at responding to external shocks or disasters. Every policy decision has a cost that we're frankly not that great at anticipating. 
 Germany:  With the Germans, it's also August, major holidays, and often a period at the height of winter (ski vacations) when you don't bother calling their offices because: a). No one will be there, or: b). You're only going to reach one or two people who aren't doing anything because everyone else is on break. I feel like I bring this up every time Reddit gets moon-eyed over German economic figures, but  be really, really careful  about applauding their current boom. Germany's numbers are a little insidious right now because everything -- absolutely everything -- is being colored by the current situation with the euro. The currency's value is being artificially depressed by economic weakness in the eurozone, and for a manufacturing-dependent nation like Germany, that is nothing but gravy. The benefits they get from having basket cases like Greece around to drag the euro massively outweigh the headache of having to deal with them. Compared to the old deutschemark, the euro is functionally equivalent to a 22-30% discount on German exports, so the Germans have every incentive to keep this devil's bargain going even if it means forcing their account surpluses (and austerity) on everyone else in the eurozone. Oh, and the German government colluded with the labor unions about a decade ago to keep wages low in order to boost employment and competitiveness, and the workers only recently won a wage hike.","The euro is very effectively hiding a lot of inefficiency in the German economy right now, but that doesn't change the fact that that inefficiency exists. Because worker productivity is typically calculated by dividing GDP (PPP) by hours worked and employment figures, this also makes German productivity look better than it actually is. 
 Otherwise, you're broadly correct that worker productivity is often negatively affected by more hours worked (e.g. Korea, Japan), but the U.S. is in a weird spot where Americans work some of the longest hours in the world, take the least vacation, but are among the most productive.  I do agree that the U.S. as a whole needs a better approach to taking time off, but let's try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The U.S. is a ridiculously wealthy country (although you'd never know it from reading Reddit), and a lot of that is tied up in the fact that Americans work hard, generally work efficiently, and are good at what they do. We need a more balanced approach to life, but again --  every policy decision has a cost . European restrictions on vacation, work hours, and hiring/firing practices make it a lot more expensive to employ a person than it is in the U.S., and [that creates a lot of problems down the line]( particularly for more vulnerable populations like young people and immigrants who find it much harder to get a job."

worldnews,cfemxi4,"Selling confiscated ivory rather than destroying it actually increases, not decreases, demand and poaching. My cut-and-paste on this subject, which I happpen to know a bit about/have an opinion on: 
 Here are a few links I've collected that explain why  selling ivory stockpiles is not a very good idea if the goal is ultimately the conservation of our remaining wild elephants: 
 > ""Peter Knights of WildAid, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in San Francisco, observed that people who argue against the destruction of ivory stockpiles think that having a legal supply is the answer to the poaching problem. But  attempts to flood the market with ivory in the past have had disastrous results, actually increasing poaching rather than curbing it. "" 
 From [Scientific American]( 
 > ""FWS director Daniel Ashe said that another problem with putting more ivory into the legal supply chain is that it would create a smokescreen for illicit trade in ivory, making law enforcement and effective prosecution of criminals more difficult."" 
 Again from Scientific American. 
 > ""But keeping the option open sends a mixed message that hinders implementation of the trade ban. In effect, this dangling revenue “carrot” signals support of a future with ivory sales and tacitly promotes the black market."" 
 From [National Geographic, on the topic of legal ivory sales]( 
 > ""under pressure from countries in Asia and southern Africa, CITES sanctioned two sales of ivory, in 1999 and 2008—stimulating poaching across the elephant range and ivory smuggling across the world."" 
 From [National Geographic Education]( 
 > ""It is extremely difficult to differentiate legally acquired ivory, such as ivory imported in the 1970s, from ivory derived from elephant poaching. Our criminal investigations and anti-smuggling efforts have clearly shown that legal ivory trade can serve as a cover for illegal trade. Therefore, selling the ivory stockpile and allowing it to enter the marketplace could contribute to increased elephant poaching and stimulate even more consumer demand for ivory."" 
 From [US Fish and Wildlife Service]( which regulates the trade in America. 
 > ""The fresh demand for raw tusks was being driven by an international agreement last year to allow a ""one-off sale"" of stockpiled ivory from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to Japan and China, Mr Omondi said. 
 > ""We have to say that what we warned would happen is happening, that this legal sale has restarted the demand for ivory, and illegal poachers and smugglers are now happily back in business to fulfil that demand,"" he said. 
 From [The Telegraph]( 
 The biggest problem that I see with the idea of selling seized ivory as legal is that most of the countries with ivory stockpiles have obscene problems with corruption already, to the point where even if selling it did work, it's a huge messy tangled web of motivations and bribing potential. They also tend to already be on shaky ground being able to enforce the laws in regards to wildlife. 
 In my incredibly biased opinion as a wildlife rehab volunteer and conservation educator, the most important thing to do in order to decrease the demand for fresh ivory is environmental education. It's the most powerful conservation tool in the world. For elephants, ivory demand, and China specifically, [this article ]( from last year states 
 >  70% of the Chinese did not realize that ivory came from dead elephants 
 All it took was an ad campaign explaining things to get these results: 
 > After exposure to the campaign, those saying they may buy ivory in the future reduced from a total of 18% down to 8%. Those saying they will definitely not buy ivory increased from 33% up to 66%. ""The main reason given for not purchasing ivory in the future is that they feel remorse because elephants are being killed,” said Gabriel. 
 We can also see how such efforts can work based on the recent successes in getting people to stop buying shark fin soup: 
 > Yao Ming’s presence in the fight to ban the selling of shark fin soup in China is being credited for an affirming-wave of anti-shark fin sentiment in Yao’s home country. 
 From [Yahoo sports]( 
 > “People said it was impossible to change China, but the evidence we are now getting says consumption of shark fin soup in China is down by 50 to 70 percent in the last two years,” said Peter Knights, executive director of WildAid, a San Francisco-based group that has promoted awareness about the shark trade. The drop is also reflected in government and industry statistics. “It is a myth that people in Asia don’t care about wildlife,” Knights said. “Consumption is based on ignorance rather than malice. ”

No European country---maybe excepting the UK---keeps the majority of its military equipment in fighting condition---the German military in exercises a few months back did not have enough rifles to give to all of their soldiers. 
 The US air force has more fighter jets and more logistics aircraft than every country in Europe combined.

worldnews,c2vun36,"Full membership does indeed seem to be reserved solely for states. The UNESCO Constitution, Article II, Section 3 specifically provides: 
 >Territories or groups of territories which are not responsible for the conduct of their international relations may be admitted as Associate Members by the General Conference by a two-thirds majority of Members present and voting, upon application made on behalf of such territory or group of territories by the Member or other authority having responsibility for their international relations. The nature and extent of the rights and obligations of Associate Members shall be determined by the General Conference. 
 I would imagine that this is the section of Article II under which the Palestinians are being admitted (admission under Article II, Section 2, would be irregular for a number of reasons; the language of Section 2 specifically stipulates eligibility of ""states"", it would go against precedent [there are several other non-full-member associates at the present time], etc.).

Much of the way Africa was split up is down to various empires too - esp. British and French, and this was the case into the 70s in France's case (Algeria for example). America supports most of these dictators through massive sales of arms in exchange for 'opening up' their markets for multinationals - oil companies especially, where applicable, but any useful natural resource will do.

worldnews,cofuisa,"I think the situation is a lot more complex than the west understands. The Crimean peninsula has a long history of Russian occupation. The large majority of the people who live there today, or at the time of the annexation, are and were Russians, speaking Russian, with a Russian culture and a pro Russian political ideology. Based on the fact that Crimea was itself ceded illegally from the Russian fsr to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954, as well as the factors described above, one could see how Russia had a rightful claim on the peninsula. If this does not persuade you, then I urge you to look at the various referendums the region of Crimea has had since the departure of the Ukrainian SSR from the USSR. In every single instance there has been more than a simple majority consensus on independence from Ukraine, each time denied by the nation they would like to break free from. 
 Yes, it was a pretty shitty way to go about receiving our land back, however all those factors taken into account it's definitely not as bad as everyone puts it. The soldiers were polite and nonviolent, the Ukrainian troops stationed there treated fairly and unharmed, free to go. The people welcomed Russian troops, unlike the hostile treatment given to the Ukrainians in the donbass/novorossiya. All in all, with 0 to few shots fires, 0 to few casualties, and happiness for all parties involved except Ukraine, it went okay. Timing could've been better and perhaps a more diplomatic approach would've looked better but what's done is done. 
 As for Ukraine, the people there decided to rebel against the current government because it was sending troops to suppress and kill protesters. You cannot deny this. Buzzing crowds with MiGs, driving tanks and APCs through eastern villages, being aggressive with people who do not hold the same mindset, this is not a democracy. So they decided to revolt against the interim government which the donbass people decided was illegal. Keep in mind their region was the hardest hit by yanukovichs corrupt economic decisions. Russia may be adding fuel to the fire but there are legitimate reasons the people of novorossiya wish to self determinate. 
 All in all I'd like to see a peaceful solution to this conflict, with no more bloodshed. We are all one Slavic people, all brothers and sisters, we shouldn't be fighting about lines on a map.

worldnews,c2x492q,"it's undeniable that an authoritarian government (with benevolent and intelligent leadership) is more effective in pursuing rapid economic development, because they can enact policy much more easily 
 No, it's very deniable. Economic development and political freedom aren't necessarily well correlated. People like to think so because the rich West is largely free and the (relatively) poor, but its more complicated. 
 They key is good policies with consistent and fair enforcement. Businesses and individuals need to be sure their investments won't be confiscated or suddenly taxed or wasted by bribing dozens of officials for approval. Its generally referred to as constitutional liberalism. This can happen in a democracy or a dictatorship, the important part is that laws are sensible and are equally and fairly applied. 
 There are plenty of examples of successes and failures for both democratic and autocratic nations going through development. China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Chile under Pinochet are good examples of dictatorial development. India is the best example of consistent democratic development. There are plenty of examples of states that have transitioned from dictatorship to democracy without damaging growth, like Turkey (multiple times), Indonesia, and South Korea. Democratic and dictatorial development failures are scattered across Sub-Saharan Africa.

There was a major uproar over the first version of the evasion7 jailbreak because of this shady Chinese App Store that was bundled with the jailbreak. Fights we're had on Twitter/reddit and a few days ago, a new version of the jailbreak was released, without that App Store installed. I think there were rumors that some Chinese company offered the evad3rs $1,000,000 for it to be bundled in, but all was found out once they released two statements.

There'll probably some speculation thrown here and there about the evad3rs now selling their jailbreaks out to companies or maybe even the NSA (tinfoil mode: or some company that is secretly the NSA), fights over communication, etc. Maybe the government will finally crack down on the whole grey issue with jailbreaking/unlocking phones (2 completely different things), making people who jailbreak their devices criminals. 
 I could possibly see them doing this solely on past apps like Install0us that allowed everyone to install any kind of app on their phone, but like with torrenting, it got overrun with people pirating paid apps. The jailbreak community has been strict on piracy and has tried its best to remove apps like Install0us or tweaks like AppSync that let you do such things.

worldnews,c0jpjsf,"I can attempt to explain the rationale behind the Japanese bases. 
 Originally the cold war made the bases absolutely mandatory, with both china and USSR projecting power into east asia. This led to a few things, the buildup to US infrastructure and political power in japan, which makes these bases convenient to operate even now. 
 The reason we keep them now is complicated, but mostly because of the above buildup. Because the US brought in marines, aircraft and such, the JSDF (japanese self defense force) went the route of not investing in a robust airforce / marines, this makes JSDF very lopsided, with very advanced naval detection, but low naval firepower, relying on US bases. 
 This means if the US were to ever pull out, the Japanese would have to immediately re-militarize, or risk being at a substantially weaker bargaining position against china / korea / russia / etc (even Taiwan has a more substantial air/naval force). Re-militarization is possibly the worst case scenario for US foreign policy, as this begins somewhat of an arms race in asia, with chilling effects on trade. Since Japan and China are both large trade partners, the US has a very strong incentive to keep them from becoming belligerent. 
 Combined with the fact that the bases allow US to gain significantly stronger bargaining power in asia (especially vs Japan), it makes no sense to shut these bases down. 
 And on the article - I dont think it mentions that this protest + political movement is being currently hijacked by right-wing japanese as a way to change the constitution banning a standing army, which is pretty worrying.","US cold war policy gimped Japanese forces, Japanese forces are now reliant on US, if US withdraws, tensions will rise in asia and US will lose out."

 In recent years, Israeli Politicians have increasingly relied on the Holocaust to defend themselves, calling everyone who criticizes them a Nazi. They even expect the German state to support them in whatever they do, even if they break International Law, because they believe that the Germans ""owe them"" because of the Holocaust. 
 At the same time they remorselessly imprison the native Palestinians in the tiny piece they ""granted them"" and which can only be described as a  Reserve . Israeli Politicians publicly talk about driving the Muslims from Gaza and take the land for Israel without being punished of criticized, while a group of Rabbi wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry declaring him an ""Enemy of God"" and basically telling him he would go to hell because he criticized the Israeli Settlement policy, which, as I mentioned indirectly above, is against International Law.

A trend I've noticed (and maybe it's just a product of the staging) is that there are a ton of youth wearing modern clothes among the ranks. A lot of people have been worrying about Islamists taking over in Libya, but I don't think we have to worry about that. The people who make up the rebel forces seem, in general, young, modern and liberal, or else middle aged and ordinary-looking (I know you can't judge a book by its cover, but no one I've seen in the NTC ranks looks like an al-Qaeda pawn... they dress too Western, etc). 
 With that being said, the threat of NTC abuses is very real and I hope this just ends quickly with as little further loss of life as possible. Also, I hope the NTC renages on its promises to the Western powers and isn't just another imperialist pawn as it is seeming to be (promising oil and bases to France and America, etc).","I don't think Libya will turn into the next Afghanistan (or Iran, although Iran is more progressive than people give it credit for), but I still think it needs to be watched closely and I hope the NTC isn't just another Western puppet as recent negotiations have suggested them to be."

Read that piece yesterday and couldn't believe the way he dealt with the Oren bit.  Hard to take any of it seriously.  For someone who (presumably?) has had a fairly serious education, Weiss's reading comprehension skills are seriously lacking. 
 At the same time, I appreciate that his site has given voice to a lot of younger American Jews who want to break with the establishment.  If we're going to be completely honest, there is still something of a taboo when it comes to American Jews openly and publicly criticizing Israel and any form of Zionism.  But the younger elements of American Jewry don't have the same connection to Israel as the older, as polling has shown, and I like that Mondoweiss gives them a space to break the taboo.  The relationships between American Jews, their Jewish identity, Israel and Zionism are dynamic and always have been.  Being able to have a discourse on that out in the open is a good thing in my opinion. 
 The Lobby stuff is so tricky.  There's no question that American Jewish Elites have considerable influence in the halls of power.  A lot of that influence is used to support Israel.  Not radical at all to admit that given that the AIPAC conference is one of the biggest political events of non-election years.

worldnews,c9cdz7j,"The US does not back Al-Nusra or any other Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Period. I will argue that Russia, Iran, Assad, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar (among others) are almost fully responsible for the rise of these groups. 
 Recently, “the most aggressive and successful arm of the rebel force” has become the Al-Qaeda splinter group Al-Nusra Front ^[1]( --the same front that was recently blamed for a chemical weapons attack. ^[2]( Al-Nusra is naturally held together by its toughest and most veteran fighters: Al-Qaeda militants from Iraq, many of whom were [ironically] given free passage there by the Syrian government. ^[3]( ^[4]( ^[5]( It is sponsored with recruits, weapons and funding from Saudi Arabia, among others. ^[6]( Although you falsely believe it does, the US does not support the same people who kill their soldiers in Iraq--can you imagine what a disaster it would be for US allies to discover that they are fighting against people who the US provides arms to? The US, [as is explained in my other big post,]( makes serious distinctions between this segment of the FSA and other segments, and the CIA works to move weapons towards more moderate elements. That post also explains how weapons proliferation in Libya has affected America’s willingness to personally add weapons to the conflict. 
 What Saudi Arabia and other regional powers are doing--proxy fighting using Islamic militants ^ 7 , ^ 9  ^[12]( necessary to stretch the conflict out long past its natural due date. Currently, the opposing sides have reached a relative stalemate. ^13 
 ^13 I have no source for this, but I cannot find a legitimate expert who claims one side is winning. 
 Here is my thesis: the length of the conflict and Russia’s barring of the West has caused Al-Nusra to succeed. The ""walking dead"" Assad regime is facing off against an increasingly bitter opposition. If we apply Darwinist evolution to combat, only the effective groups survive and thrive, which attracts recruits and further funding in an almost snowball effect. It also tends towards extremists. Who is effective? We can certainly define effectiveness by what it is not: the moderates are becoming depleted, are vastly underaided, and have had less success in combat. We can also define it as whomever is most active, is most involved, and is most well-armed and supplied. That's Jabhat al-Nusra, the Al-Qaida Syrian jihadists, now supplemented and supplied by several regional powers. Their unity of purpose and combat effectiveness attracts lots of new recruits. 
 Although particularly brutal and extended wars create extremists, the process may take time to build momentum. The best example is from the Balkans after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, where the Serb army increasingly extremized and eventually committed genocide, but the anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan also serve as fine examples of extremists making gains in long, desperate wars. ^[14] Fighters need time to become bitter enough with the war that they become fanatic or volunteer up their personal ideologies in favor of efficiency and safety with whoever is most successful. Why would you stay with the group that is constantly running out of ammunition when you could join the group that, although extreme, offers a new sense of purpose and a history of success? And if you stick around long enough, how likely are you to convert to their greater cause? Honestly, it’s the same story with consumer goods: a good reputation creates a Mathew Effect of attracting customers. 
 ^14 Wikipedia does a fine job describing these incidents: [1. Yugoslav Wars,]( [2. Soviet War in Afghanistan]( 
 The moderate wing of the FSA is reaching this point. Many moderate fighters had pinned their hopes on NATO and are now furious, disappointed, and almost bled dry. More effective jihadists have capturing military bases with heavy weaponry ^[15]( and made some successes that may seem almost miraculous. On the moderate side, Stratfor speaks eloquently: 
 > Many fighters who had pinned their hopes on NATO were greatly disappointed and angered that their suffering was ignored. It is not unusual for Syrian fighters to say something akin to, ""What has the West done for us? We now have only God."" 
 Early rhetorical support from NATO nations led army defectors to expect military aid, but they received almost nothing substantive, at least in comparison to Al-Nusra; according to Syrian National Council chief Moaz Al-Khatib, that almost nothing dwindles even lower as jihadist groups gain traction. In February, this problem led Syria’s opposition chief to declare readiness to talk to regime officials. He is not speaking for the full opposition, especially not the jihadist elements—they are making gains. Although wildly biased, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights at least spoke for the opposition when its director stated: ""the international community has made many promises and that none have come into fruition."" If moderate fighters received the aid and training they needed from the West, perhaps they would have become the more effective fighting force within the opposition, capable of attracting recruits who have now joined the jihadists instead. 
 Many NATO allies have previously declared some support for rebel movements. Then again, the jihadists hadn't hijacked as much influence back then. Now, it would be impossible to find full support for the FSA among many ""western nations"" like France, America, or Germany. 
 However, Russia, Iran and Assad are clearly unable to end this war. If anybody cares enough to reverse the trend of extremization*, you need to help out the moderate wing of the FSA--give them an evolutionary advantage. It’s not an impossible feat, and it dramatically increases America’s deserved image from that of the abandoner to that of the supporter. Wantonly adding weapons isn’t the only method: I fully support the provision of any non-lethal aid that will increase both the survivability and the leadership capabilities of the moderate wing of FSA: especially training, but also Kevlar vests, night vision goggles, medical supplies, etc. These are the forms of support that America has openly given to rebels. However, this is clearly both inadequate, long term, and subtle so that it leaves a weak impression. The CIA has, for a long time, sat around the border and helped distribute weapons to less extreme rebel groups—and very sound policy. Although I will never support heavy weapon aid, I am of the opinion that once this conflict is over, the black market for small arms will already be so full that the worseness of each additional weapon trails off almost logarithmically (please don’t fry me for my poor math analogies). Providing the necessary tools to increase the effectiveness of the moderate FSA factions isn't a very dangerous option right now, so long as they are not providing rare weapons like stinger missiles or MANPADS.

worldnews,c0k0cwx,"I'm sorry. The ""kindhearted Muslims"" part of my story was more of just a rant about how I thought Muslims as a whole were being portrayed in this article and the media today. 
In regards to the ruling of this case, it is difficult for me to say exactly why it happened the way that it did. Above, bluehawk_one says: 
>Most likely story 
The guy was pardoned because he's from a powerful family, as in powerful corrupt politicians. 
The girl was given a full ""punishment"" because of the trigger-happy pervertedness of the ""elders."" 
This stuff only happens, rarely at that, in the seriously uneducated backwaters of the country. 
 It is difficult for me to speak about exactly why I think the ruling went the way it did because I am Shi'ite while, according to Wikipedia, Bangladesh is 97% Sunni. However, I will still give my viewpoint. 
Personally (I doubt this view will be shared by many other Muslims), I think that some of the Islamic laws and Hadiths are not God's will. The reason I believe this is because the Qur'an was not written down in the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad. It was committed only to membory, so by the time it was written down, I would assume that there was some sort of Chinese Whisper effect on some parts as Islam spread. Now, I doubt people were in every city and village making sure that these new converts were practicing the right things. Things may have been held together very tightly within the center of the Arabian and Persian empire, but rule was much looser near the edge of these empires. I think that this is why there are so many differing looks on things, even within the same sects of Islam. If Islam spread to a village, they could have easily said: ""Oh this is a cool religion, but oh, wait, that part completely contradicts with what we stand for... so let's just not follow that."" With no one (or few? I can't really say for sure because I don't really know) governing exactly how this village practices Islam, a thousand years could easily go by without anybody correcting them. By this time, this is their Islamic law. 
 Sorry, this comment has kind of gone all over the place. I think the","answer to your question is it is incredibly difficult to say why the ruling went the way it did. The Islamic laws may have been misinterpreted or preexisting elements from societies may have influenced laws. Again, not all sects completely mesh on ideals (see the  Kharijites .

 You ever wondered why to this day, both the left and right wing stand as viable philosophies? You're going off the assumption that left-wing ideology is the undoubted route, and right-wing mentality is evil and wrong. And your use of ""general"" means, as usual, you are making a sweeping statement concerning politics and world issues that are above and beyond you. Keep in mind that the left-wing has spawned just as much chaos as the right-wing has in history. You don't have to look too far. When Mao took power in China he led a campaign to clamp down on all rightists, thereby securing the irrevocable implication of leftist ideals in China. His reign eventually led to the deaths of millions of nationals. This just goes to show that neither house is particularly positive, and thereby invalidates your claim. 
 You also offered up a plethora of writeups and academia that validate your stand that atheism is that much more honorable than religion. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I'd venture to say you haven't read half of what you linked. 
 And as I said, you completely glossed over the fact that I called you out for making wide statements encompassing entire communities. Do you know what percentage of the world remains in some religion or another? And yet you are able to make a claim applicable to each and every individual who subscribed to a religious belief in a few curt statements. I am hard-pressed to provide you with relevant articles to counter-act yours, because the atheist community (see /r/atheism for more info) has been highly successful in bastardizing all religious claims. Should I provide you with any counter-argumentative articles, you would easily fling them aside with the claim that your facts are more legitimate.

 > Unlike religious people atheists don't identify with any kind of doctrine or any kind of other bullshit. The only thing that connects all atheists is that they don't believe in any god 
 This is atheism put in theory. But as you have proven, the lack of a belief in a god has become just as much a radical doctrine as many other religions out there. Your glorification of science and technology is just as much a religious fervor as worship of a god is. Not to say science and technology is not good. It is, and as a religious person I put great faith in it as well, but the difference is that atheism glorifies it in lieu of a god that they have expelled from their faith system.

worldnews,c9gwzxl,"Not so much an untruth as an over simplification. 
 Currently a significant number of high profile attacks against the west have been carried out by Muslims, terrorism is political by it's very definition and so certain ideologies will rise and vanish over the years depending on the actions of states. I'm from the UK and whereas Islam is the threat currently, not that long ago it was Irish groups. In other countries terrorism is carried out by separatist movements, religious groups or those affiliated with political causes which have no link whatsoever to Islam. 
 Currently one of the main terrorist threats to America and other western nations is Islamic extremism. Terrorism requires a strong ideology that motivates and radicalizes people, this can't exist in a vacuum. American actions in the middle east have lead to an increase in radicalization among citizens in countries where they have a military presence, at the same time anti Muslim rhetoric and Islamophobia leads to radicalization at home. Domestic citizens are more likely to become radicalized than immigrants. It's a case of groups on both sides growing by feeding off the other. 
 There is a significant threat currently from Islamic extremism, however other terrorist threats are also present but receive less attention because the methods used are not as dramatic. These include nationalist groups, extreme animal rights campaigners, acts by pro-choice or Christian fundamentalist groups and eco-terrorism to name just examples in America and in all of these instances the presence of Muslims is negligible. 
 Not to mention the Muslim element itself is even a bit misleading, although the rhetoric involved may come from Muslim leaders and communities with a high proportion of Muslims those involved typically don't have a strong understanding of the religion itself, in fact those that are very devout and deeply involved in Islam as a religion have been found to be be more resistant to radicalization.",Basically it's more useful to look at terrorism as a political phenomenon rather than something associated solely with one religious or ethnic group since which group it is that constitutes a threat is ultimately reliant on the political context of the time.

 It's not, it's a simple observation. 
 You seems to be asking about the mechanics behind that ? It's pretty simple, as soon as any power (whatever it's origin) is in a position to establish it's authority by force (an army when it comes to state/countries/colonial power) in a specific zone it tend to create stability in said zone (most of the time it's the interest of said power).

 I, for one, am always shocked and appalled when people behave in a manner entirely consistent with their beliefs.  I am not Catholic, so I may be wrong about all of this.  But, my understanding is that confession is necessary for forgiveness of sins and that forgiveness of sins is necessary to not spend an eternity in hell. 
 The point of confession is to make oneself right with God, not with any particular Earthly authority.  And, that moral obligation to God would supersede obligations to any other authorities.  By guaranteeing that the confession would be repeated to the police they would be setting up a barrier to confession and therefore endangering the parishioners immortal soul. 
 If fear of legal and social reprisal makes the parishioner delay a single day in confessing and in that day they die then that delay and the cause of it have doomed them to an eternity of suffering.  Although I am not a lawyer, I feel confident in saying that no crime under any government is punishable by eternal suffering.  That, however, may only be the case because of logistical problems. 
 Now, this is the part that I am least familiar with.  My understanding is that forgiveness is reliant on an act of penance.  That required act is decreed by the priest and is based on the severity and nature of the sin.  For an extreme sin such as this I do not imagine that a few Hail Marys would be sufficient but that the priest would require the criminal to turn themselves in.  I do not know what they would do for a severe crime when the criminal does not follow through on that.",Automatically turning people in could prevent them from confessing and thus endanger their immortal soul.

 It's Pearl Harbor.  While Japan did attack Pearl Harbor, instigating a war, it was because America and the other Western powers were carving up Asia into colonies.  Japan felt it was next on the chopping block because the U.S. wanted it as a stop on it's way to trade with the rest of Asia.  The two Asian judges (chosen by the Allies from Allied colonies, India and the Philippines, articulated this chain of thought during the Tokyo Trials).  Not to mention, Commodore Perry instigated the overthrow of a fundamentally neutral, non-Fascist bakufu government when he demanded Japan open up.  EDIT: This is not to condone Japan's going to war (the judges thought that while the Japanese government may of that it was under threat, it may not have actually been).  Nor is it to condone the behavior of the Japanese army in Asia (something my family was affected by).  However, this is how soldiers act during all wars in foreign countries. 
 
 The use of Atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was very different - the effect on civilians at the time was horrifying (and sickening - I look at pictures and read accounts of the carnage at that time) and it sickens me.  And that is coming from a person who's grandparents were forced to run on-foot from Mynmar to their native Bangladesh when the Japanese army invaded.  This is not to mention the effects atomic radiation has had on people born during and AFTER the war.  I believe the seminal book about this is 1000 Paper Cranes, about a young girl born far after the war getting cancer.  Moreover, I doubt the U.S. would have used atomic weapons against a country it was racial and culturally affiliated with, like it was Germany.  The U.S. wanted to test the atomic weapons it had gotten from Germany and wanted to scare Russia off, as the fight with the U.S.S.R. was already looming. 
 
 We did not build Japan into a modern, functioning democracy. 
 
 
 A. Japan is not a functioning democracy.  50 years of LDP rule does not suggest democracy.  A few years of schizophrenic Democratic Party rule does not a democracy make.  Many scholars suggest that Japan is not really a functional democracy.  Whether one subscribes to that view is another point and this is overall a minor point. 
 B. The U.S. was ready to rescind any cool political or democratic feature given to Japan (for example, Article 9 of the constitution, renouncing the collective right of war) for the Korean War 10 years later.  This is another somewhat minor point (but more important that A, if you ask me). 
 C. Most of the groundwork for a modern nation was laid during the Meiji and Taisho periods.  Japan didn't become a major world power capable of participating in a world war out of nowhere.  The Meiji period saw a sustained and focused drive towards modernization.  America overlaid some democratic ideals but Japan had at least adopted the trappings of European government well before the war.  If America made Japan a democracy it should do the same in Afghanistan and Iraq - it can't because you can't ""make"" a democracy.

 In short, you don't really know what you're talking about.  I doubt this comment will see the light of day buried down in this thread, but the level of misinformation about World War II in the U.S. (probably because we stop learning about it in middle or high school) is remarkable. 
 Americans have no collective guilt because Americans don't feel guilty about any of the bad things our nation has done (except perhaps slavery and to some degree our treatment of Native Americans, though neither to the extent warranted) - Vietnam, regime change in Iran, ""manifest destiny,"" GTMO, atomic weapons, propping up Sadaam Hussein during the 80s as a hedge against Iran) because most Americans believe the U.S. is the city on the hill, incapable of doing anything wrong."

 The immigrants, though, are a huge problem. We have buttloads of immigrants, which would be cool if they were actually decent people, which some of them are, but many are not. 
 Here's a video for you, if you want to take a closer look at the rioters 
 The problem with Sweden is that we accept too many immigrants, too fast, making integration impossible. 
Suburbs of major cities are inhabited almost exclusively of immigrants, with high crime rates.(Shootings, drugs, all that shit) 
 People come here and get subventions for sitting on their asses, speaking their mother-tongue. The incentive for people to start working is low because they get their driver's licenses paid and get money for food + clothes. They live in segregated areas with people who speak their native language, so why would they need to learn Swedish? 
 The problem behind the immigration is that the whole mentality of the politicians who betray us is to sweep the problem with immigration under the rug, because if you say immigration is a problem, you're racist. 
This is a huge problem in Sweden, Swedes themselves are playing the racist card just so that other Swedes won't call them racists. 
 Sidetrack: Last week, a school stopped kids from dressing up as gingerbread-cookies. (Tradition in Sweden is Lucia [ where we dress up as stuff and sing)
Why? Because it's obviously racist. 
 Another part that sucks with immigration is exactly this ^
Sweden is adapting to the immigrants and not the other way around. 
We change our traditions, schools don't sing the National Anthem during ceremonies anymore, pools are gender-segregatet, food in schools is haram, yadda, yadda, list goes on... 
 Different cultures cannot coexist well. At least not here in Sweden.
Muslim immigrants (no offense, but these muslims suck) are on the same mental level as a lobotomized golden retriever, seriously, most immigrants I meet or talk to are aggressive and non-intelligent excuses for human beings, they are like cattle, just shoving their own beliefs down peoples' throats.

 Next up you have to consider how the land was developed namely lots of suburban housing and civic planning.  These things don't go hand in hand with public transit well at all. 
 What this all means from a practicality standpoint is that public transit can and does work in the US in isolated areas of high population density.  Places like New York, DC, etc have decent public transit options available and they could be improved. 
 The problem is that most of the US population commutes some degree everyday and a decently major commute at that (by Euro and Asian standards).  This makes the personal vehicle basically the way life works and its not something that can ""just change"" it would require people to move OUT of the suburbs in massive numbers and into cities which would cause all sorts of economic issues that its not something that going to happen outside of a fantasy or a ""bad end"".

Solar is regional based and even then has a high startup cost and is directly effected by climate unlike now which is 24/7 stability. 
 As to Saudi Oil the US ""dependence"" on it is grossly overstated.  The US only imports abit over 50% of its oil, 40%+ of US oil is domestic.  32% of the imported oil is straight from Canada.  Only 13% of the US oil imports are from Saudi Arabia. 
What this means is that while Saudi Oil does have an impact on the US it is much smaller than most people seem to think/are led to believe.  All said and done oil from the middle east makes up around 20% of the oil in the US and while thats not an insignificant figure its by no means a irreplaceable figure either. 
 In general it is the European and Asian nations that are dependent on oil imports specifically from the middle east and Russia (oil from middle east, natural gas from Russia). 
 That page has a few decent graphs on showing projected increases/decreases on fuel imports/exports and another showing more or less current situations.  Europe and Japan are consistently doing very poorly and are highly reliant on imports where as China and the US are both doing rather decent for major nations, and while the US is decreasing its dependence China is increasing theirs. 
 The importance of Saudi Arabia comes not from oil/finance (from a US perspective) but in the form of stability.  For better or worse KSA is pretty stable, or ESPECIALLY STABLE given its regional neighbors.  It also plays ball with the US military giving a local land based area for the US military to land, service, etc there aircraft/troops. 
Syria, Jordan, Iran, Iraq, you name it most of the middle east is either on poor terms with the US or unstable as all fuck.

For the most part everyone knew which side each country would fall on, with the exception of the United States [which could have just as easily ended up fighting against the British instead of the Germans]. Even the Belgium forces knew that their country was likely to become a battleground early in the war, given the fortifications the French were doing in the south-east. What they didn't know was whether Germany would invade first as a quicker way into France, or if Britain would invade first to ""protect"" Belgium from a German invasion. That's why the tiny country spent so much time in the decades prior to WW1 heavily fortifying their cities. 
 Also, MAD existed back then as well. All the advances in technology meant that each power saw attacking another power as a suicidal move [in the sense that it would cost a lot and, even if victorious would not result in any financial benefit]. The alliance of Russia-Britain-France was designed as a MAD-style deterrent to prevent the Germans from starting a continental war. They believed that there was no way the Germans could fight all of them at once. The reason why MAD failed to prevent the July Crisis from spiraling into war was because the Germans thought that they had gained first-strike capability following their secret advances in mobile heavy-artillery & thus they believed they would be able to defeat France before the British or Russians could engage. That's why the famous book ""Guns of August"" was written & given its title [by guns the author means the secret heavy siege artillery that the Germans used to force their way threw Liege into France]. 
 Matter of fact it was that same book,  The Guns of August  that JFK was reading when the Cuban Missile Crisis started, and it had convinced him that MAD was not completely fool-proof and could not always be relied on.

worldnews,c4c4x03,"You have a very astute observational style. The patterns you describe however are applicable to the period of human history known as the Holocene, particularly post-Agricultural Revolution. This gradual congealing of populations into urban conurbations and the subsequent stratification from 8000BC onwards of societies allowed for much more male-dominant, hierarchical civilisations that need control over their workers as the primary method for functioning, hence religion, politics, armies, wars, etc. These things are derived from the need to secure a food source, not as a specific function of our 'inner nature'. 
 True, the higher primates (apes) function in male dominant hierarchies with alpha males bullying the others for dominance, but in pre-agricultural human populations there is overwhelming evidence for the existence of a 'partnership-based society', where men and women were given equal status, and where the needs of the tribe were given a higher priority than the needs of the individual. Perhaps I would be so bold as to say that our current cultural conditioning is so strong that even attempting to describe this gender-based union is met with ridicule and derision, but evidence from modern research into indigenous tribes suggests that partnership societies were the commonality among humans before agriculture. Female goddess worship, and non-paternal lineage/kinship ties were common. 
 This 'struggle for meaning' you mention is what interests me most. In these archaic societies, the dissolution of the ego was (and still is) viewed as paramount to the groups survival, hence shamans were (and are still) awarded great importance in regards to the spiritual and mental health of the group. They worked through ceremonies involving dance, chanting, drumming and primarily psychoactive plants to dissolve the egos of the tribal individuals into the group. This allowed a more harmonious existence, co-operation within the tribe and less emphasis on individual gain over others. Humans still search for this dissolution of ego and joining with something divine, leading to the abuse of alcohol and drugs on a regular basis, something we all have come to know of as 'getting out of our heads'. Curious how legal substances available today are more toxic and ego-binding than those our ancestors were taking... 
 Recent research is suggesting that psychedelic substances and other archaic methods encourage the dissolution of both the dominator-orientated culture and the harmful effects of the individual worshipping cult. Without the shamanic tools our ancestors developed, humans can and will revert to the behavior that their ancestors display as primates, and these to my mind are what you describe above.","If we had shamans and the  responsible use of psychedelics  were allowed, less bad shit would happen in the world."

worldnews,c954fk4,"But why should the bank lend out MY money to other people? 
 Wow. That's how banks make money, from the spread in borrowing/lending interest rate. If you don't let them lend it to anyone then you wouldn't be getting an interest rate but you'd actually have to pay them to keep it safe. If you don't want your money lent to anyone then keep it in a sock at home. You can also rent a safe deposit box in a bank and keep the money there. 
 >Isn't this what banks in the old days used to do... keep your gold safe and charge you for the service? 
 No, they'd lend it to someone in order to make a profit. They leveraged less but that's because they were much smaller and liquidity back was awful. 
 Anyone who deposits it at a bank does so because they expect a return on it and that can only happen if the bank can invest it / lend it to someone. 
 The reason our banking system works the way it does is because it greatly increases the efficiency of the entire economy. If you stuck your money in a deposit box somewhere it wouldn't be available to anyone else. This way someone can lend it and start/expand a business or buy a house/car. This on a large scale means more growth and increase in standard of living. A big chunk of growth in 20th century was thanks to improvements in the financial system. 
 You can still keep the money in a sock at home or in a safe at a bank, but nobody does that because they not only lose out on interest rate, but they have to pay for the service + inflation eats away at the money slowly.",there's already a channel to do what you're suggesting but nobody does it because it's dumb

 Why must 99.8% of people worldwide/USA desire to be decisively on one team? Probably partly because most of the US Congress don't know the Capital city of Ukraine. 
 Truth be told this is a predominately European problem and will remain one I believe. I think that's the conclusion you came to, as well.

 They [The European countries and/or NATO members] aren't on their own, but are we going to engage the Russian Armed Forces directly over ANY Non-NATO State? It would take some pretty coinciding human blunders and misunderstandings for that to happen, so I highly highly highly doubt it.

worldnews,cokngna,"The thing about the Syrian civil war is that there are more then 2 sides. There is Assads Government, which wants to control all of syria again like it did before the start of the war. There is ISIS, which wants to turn basically the whole world into an islamic caliphate under their crazy rule. But there also are other rebels, the so called Free Syrian Army, who are fighting against Assad but are not pro-ISIS. And then there obviously are the kurds who want to use this chaos to create an independent kurdistan. 
 Now, had the US invaded Syria right after the civil war started with assad attacking then-peaceful protesters, Syria would not be in the hand of ISIS now. Why? Well, first off, ISIS is an Iraqi Movement which only joined the Syrian civil war later on. Had that war ended quick through US intervention, ISIS would have never even entered Syria. Furthermore, at the beginning of the Revolution, the radical islamic movements and groups were pretty weak. At the beginning, the movement was mostly secular. Who would be in charge now if we had toppled Assad  right away , you ask? Well, thats pretty hard to answer, who knows what Syria would look like now after democratic elections followed the fall of Assad, but it surely would not have been under the rule of an islamist group as radical as ISIS. 
 As for the situation right now and your claim that Assad is fighting ISIS right now, lets look at this  map of the war , has pretty much become the leading group of the rebels in the northwest. The only rebel groups which do not mainly consist of jihadists are the rebels in the southwest around daara and quneitra. 
 The reason why most rebel groups have evolved into radical islamists now is pure pragmatism. It is because the West was not arming them or helping them in any way. It is because they needed help because Assad attacked them with modern Russian Tanks, he attacked them with Artillery, he attacked them with his Airforce and he killed their families (or just random people living in rebel areas) by dropping barrel bombs on rebel held areas. Meanwhile, the Rebel forces consisted of inexperienced, untrained people with a few Kalashnikovs. 
 The moderate Rebels needed help, but no one helped them. They waited for the West to do something against Assads genocide, but the West didn't to anything. Eventually, they looked for help from the only groups that were willing to help them: Groups like Jabhat al-nusra and ISIS. Those groups had exactly what the rebels lacked: Combat experience from Iraq/Afghanistan, well trained Special Force-like units and the ability to execute devastating suicide Attacks. Thus, the rebels slowly evolved into the radical Islamist Groups we see today, although a few still refuse to ally themselves too closely with al nusra or to become ISIS (ISIS has no allies, you either defect to ISIS or you are their enemy). Again, the rebels in the south of Syria are the ones with the least amount of Jihadist Influence. 
 Now, which group do you think Assad is fighting the hardest at the moment. The rebels + al-nusra in the Northwest? The gruesome ISIS in the Northeast? No, he obviously fights the (rather) moderate Rebels in the southwerst. Why? Well, put yourself in Assads shoes. You can either help the coalition defeat ISIS, lose a lot of soldiers in the process and then stand weakened in the fight against the moderate rebels which most of the world sympathises with. Or you can just attack the Rebels, attacking the most moderate, western friendly groups first of course, while coalition airstrikes prevent ISIS from launching a big Attack on your position so in the end, it will become ISIS against Assad. Well, you obyiously will attack the rebels first. 
 Because if it ever truly becomes ISIS against Assad, regardless of how big ISIS is, Assad wins because the US cannot let ISIS win and thus must help Assad. However, If it is Assad against (somewhat) moderate Rebels, the outcome is way less predictable. 
 Thus, Assad is right now launching an offensive against the rebel-held positions in the south while ISIS, being the Iraqi organisation that they originally are, is trying to launch offensives in Iraq and, in the long term, trying to defend the Iraqi city of Mosul. The Kurds are fighting ISIS, but they will only fight until they have pushed ISIS off of the Kurdish regions. Finally, if ISIS ever launches an offensive in Syria again, it would probably either be against the kurds or against the rebels in Aleppo, because the rebels are a way easier target to defeat then the Government","Assad is not fighting against ISIS, he is fighting against what is left of the rebellion. Had the US disposed Assad right after the start of the Rebellion, ISIS would have never entered Syria and we would not read about children crucified in Syria at all.

Seems like they would have gotten a visual earlier than Air France got their situation figured out, but possibly (and tragically) not.

worldnews,c8mjwjq,"Sorry for bothering you but I'm just going to provide a Christian viewpoint. I know discussing religion is taboo on the internet but I'll try and defend Christians without being a twat. 
 The first thing you need to know is that the Bible was not always one book. It's really a compilation of a bunch of documents written by loads of different people over a long period of time and are just bunched together to help readers. 
 One of these documents is a letter written by a doctor named Luke nicknamed ""Acts"" which is worth looking into (it's about 3/4's of the way through the Bible). It happened after Jesus' life and death. A section of it involves Jesus telling one of his disciples that because of his sacrifice (death and resurrection), foods (and non-Jews for that matter) were no longer considered unclean. Basically, pork could be eaten and non-Jews could go to heaven. 
 The passage you're alluding to however happens at a different point in history, hundreds of years earlier before Jesus was even born. They were directly relevant for when they were written but are less relevant post-Jesus. 
 Christians believe that cleanliness passages such as ""do not eat pork"" were directly applicable up until the point where Jesus died and came back to life. Areas such as homosexual relations are not viewed as cleanliness issues but rather as moral issues which mean they are viewed differently post Jesus. This is mostly because of post-Jesus references to homosexuality being viewed as a result of sin. 
 The most important thing to remember is that Christians should not hate people. You probably know this, but Christians don't (shouldn't) claim to be perfect. They should claim to be just as broken as the rest of humanity, atheists, muslims, the like. The difference is that Christians try to serve God by living for him as much as they can (which isn't much :/) 
 According to Christianity, being homosexual won't send you to hell, rather ignoring your ""get out of jail free"" card (Jesus) will send you to hell. While it is perfectly okay (and in fact encouraged) for Christians to encourage other Christians to abstain from homosexual relations, it is by no means okay for Christians to rebuke homosexual atheists for being homosexual; in fact the reverse is closer to the truth: Christians should encourage homosexual atheists to come and know God and should ignore any homosexuality.","Context explains your concern. All Christians also being fundamentally flawed (including me) explains your douchebag Christian associates. 
 DISCLAIMER: Not implying all atheists are homosexuals, just that there are some atheists who are also homosexual who get picked on"

 Perhaps not surprisingly, the Italian students hate this idea. They are uncomfortable with their knowledge of the English language and want the classes to remain being taught in Italian. On the first day of classes this semester, I approached the instructor (who happens to be the head of the department) to ask him if there would be material available online in English. I should state that I know some Italian, but not well enough to follow what the professors say word for word in class. I usually learn everything outside of class on my own. I am fine with the classes being taught in Italian even though I have trouble with the language because I knew that this is what I was getting into. 
 Anyway, when the class rejoins, the professor makes a long speech about how teaching in Italian is holding the university back and that all the best and newest research and books are in English, etc etc. He proposes to do an experiment by teaching the rest of the class in English. He asks the students if it is ok that he teaches in English for the remaining hour as a test and they complain but the professor does it anyway. 
 After the lecture is finished, he asks the class what they think about it and they all hate it. One student was particularly upset. The professor said that he thought he actually teaches better in English because he explains the material in a more focused manner (he usually goes off wild tangents), but the one student says he doesn't want English even if the lesson is taught better and that he prefers that the professor speaks in Italian even if they don't learn the material because the lessons are unfocused. The classes have since been taught in Italian and even the Italians don't understand the material. 
 I am sure that a lot of the students think that I asked the professor to teach in English and hate me for it. Most of the students already know me as the foreign student that doesn't understand Italian from classes I took last semester. The professor also stopped during his lecture to ask me how to say an English word so everyone probably thinks the professor was catering to me personally.

worldnews,cjuk6it,"I agree completely but the thing about Obama or Harper's position is that they are already in an established democracy. When any revolution happened (French, American, Iran (kinda orchestrated but we'll use it)) the entire administration was uprooted before attempting to establish any sort of new government. The Egyptians didn't do that for fear of becoming what they worked hard to overcome, but it was obviously necessary (20/20 hindsight). Also Morsi's meddling was simply lowering the retirement age by 5-10 years, in order to get the older generation (Mubarak's generation) of judges to move on - he didn't a) implement this b) actually force anyone to leave. He only urged them to leave. Not to mention that this old administration, including the army, was not elected, but it was appointed. He didn't push to remove it by any means, simply to push for those who were with Mubarak's admin not to be in charge anymore. 
 Also it has to be noted that the parliament (which was used to for legislation) was dissolved within a few days of Morsi's election - he was left without tools to instigate change. The first thing the coup leader did when he overthrew Morsi was give himself legislative powers (the ones people flipped about when Morsi announced them) and began changing laws despite protests - Morsi repealed his legislative powers due to protests within a couple weeks. 
 The fact of the matter is that the entire situation was knew to them, and they didn't know how to act when people were constantly attacking them. Living in Egypt at the time, there was a bus crash into a train, and 60 kids died. Horrible tragedy, and Morsi gave a speech. Yet people actually blamed  him  directly for the incident. ""He wasn't emotional enough in his speech"" ""He didn't make new laws to change the way trains are run"" (despite not having a parliament?) ""See what happens when Islamists are in power? We should have let Nasser deal with them once and for all (i.e. killed them)"" Were all things recycled and told by the media and the populace. 
 I gotta be honest I didn't support the Brotherhood. I only supported them when it was either them or one of the main ministers from Mubarak's regime in the elections (because I'm not about to support the dude who worked with the dude we just overthrew). And I disagree with some of the actions they've taken, and agree with some.

No other country has had a Jon Stewart type comedian in the resident country make direct fun of the president.

worldnews,c2aiuub,"There is actually more social interaction between the genders in Iran than in any other country I have been to in the Middle East (I cycled eastwards from Europe across Turkey, Syria, Iran, UAE and Oman.) Turkey and Syria are legally secular countries but there are strong social pressures ensuring segregation between men and women. Note I am referring here to  eastern  Turkey and my interactions with locals (not ex-pats) in UAE/Oman. 
 In Iran women would come up to me in the street for a chat simply as I was a foreigner. That happened in no other Middle Eastern country. The Iranians are amazingly hospitable and we were invited back to stay with a lot of families, often just from people we met on the street. 
 The men and women of the family all sat down to dinner together, the man would often help in the kitchen, etc. Note this went for the most religious families as much as the non-religious ones. This did not happen outside Iran, where although we were ocassionally invited back we were entertained seperately and did not meet the women of the family. 
 In Iran you see young couples in the street, cafes, etc. who are clearly not married or related. We met such couples; they meet at university or wherever.  In the context of the Middle East  the segregation that exists is pretty light. 
 In Iran, only 15% of marriages are arranged. Contrast India where I didn't meet a single married couple who had not had their marriage arranged by their parents. One lovely Indian guy I stayed with had a girlfriend, but was forced to drop her when his parents found him a wife. A month later and they were married. Of course this is a social pressure rather than a legal one, but it is no less real. 
 Iran actually comes across as pretty Western in comparison... the population are highly educated, very interested in the outside world, and of course amazingly hospitable (on a different scale to any other country I have been to.) The government is not entirely without support but it certainly isn't popular.",Iran is a very different country than the impression given in the Western media.

worldnews,c8oliqu,"You're almost entirely misplaced in your anger, even though your sentiment is correct. 
 Bankers are in the business of money. Doctors heal people, farmers grow food, bankers allocate money. Money is a resource, just like anything else, and what bankers really do is take money from people and give it to other people, and take a cut of that money to do so. 
 To say that they contribute nothing is silly. The fact is, almost everything that is mass-produced needs a banker to make it happen. Individuals and even corporations do not have the money to do the things they want to do. Do you want to buy a house? How would you do that without a mortgage? Does GM want to build a new factory? How will they fund a multi-billion dollar expansion with cash they don't have? The answer, obviously, is bankers. Bankers take money from people - deposits from savings accounts, investments from wealthy people, loans from governments or other ways - and give it to other people. This is, essentially, banking. You want to buy a house. I want to take my money and put it somewhere safe. Banks act as an intermediary to let me keep my money safe, while letting you buy your house. 
 Sounds great, right? You get your house, I get to keep my money safe. What's in it for the bank? Well, they're going to pay me some money to keep my money with them, and they're going to make you pay some money later for giving you money now. The difference between these two interest rates is their profit. Why do they deserve this profit? Well, they did do the service of taking my money and getting you your money, and they do assume the liability of paying me out, even if you default on your mortgage. Seems low risk, right? Sure, but one loss can wipe out lots and lots of wins. Losses can also be highly correlated - if everyone's losing their jobs, we're all going to default together AND we're all going to need our money from our savings accounts to cover expenses. That's what happened in 2008. 
 The real problems happen when we start dealing in scales much, much bigger than just a mortgage. Start looking at the debt market for an example. Companies need lots and lots of money to function, and they'll fund it by entering into agreements to take a lot of money from you now in exchange for paying you more money later. This is what bonds are. The bond market is ENORMOUS. Every bond deal runs through a bank. With a market near $100tn (source: just google it!), that's a lot of bonds. At a fee of just 1%, that's $1tn in profits just from the bonds. Bonds carry with them risk. To offset this risk, companies will take insurance (called derivatives), which offer to pay people in the event something happens. Take the CDS (credit default swap) - if a bond defaults, you get paid. It's bond insurance! More fees for the banks. Of course, we can revisit 2008 to see how these factored into the problems. Banks wrote CDS on their mortgage-backed bonds and sold them. Now, when the mortgages defaulted, the banks not only had to pay out on the bonds, but they had to pay off the insurance in case the bonds defaulted. Ouch. 
 So banks take lots of fees to give people money, and get really rich doing it. Why do we support them for this? Because, honestly, they're right. They are the backbone of the economy. Without an intermediary to compile money and allocate it to people who need it, we wouldn't be able to achieve the scale of the businesses that we do. We wouldn't be able to do business over great distances (think about the service your bank provides with credit and debit cards, or what exactly goes into letting you buy a PS4 off eBay from someone across the world) without banks. We wouldn't even get to do the expensive things we want to do, like buying a house or going to college, without banks. Banks give people all the money they want, and charge them healthy fees to do it (that's really what a mortgage or a student loan is - present-you borrowing money from future-you so you can do something you want to do now). 
 There are two fundamental flaws with the banking system. The first is that banks are incentivized to let people take risk. Do you really need that third house? Probably not, since you're working at McDonalds part time, but the bank won't tell you that. They make money off the fee from your mortgage, they make money securitizing that mortgage and selling it and they make money from selling all of these things to another company to manage. Banks have no incentives to care about your best interests. Their incentive is to make money, which they do by doing deals. Now, because they're critical to the economy (people and companies will ALWAYS need money), they're going to be given all the help they need to stay in business. Even the people they do business with have incentive to help them! After all, if I have deposited $200,000 with you, I'd probably prefer to give you $20,000 to stay in business than lose all $200,000. This means that risks are socialized, even though profits are not. If bankers win big, they get paid big. If they lose big, everyone loses. This is a terrible system, but hardly the fault of the bankers. Is it fair to blame someone for playing to the advantages that a system gives them? 
 The second issue is knowledge. Remember what I said at the beginning of this post - banks are in the business of money. Nobody knows money better than they do, no matter what you think. This allows them to consistently get the better of their counterparties in deals. You might think getting your mortgage at only 1.0% is a steal, but if they're paying 0.1% in interest on the deposits that let them fund that mortgage, they're making 0.9% on that deal. That doesn't seem like much, right? What if they were doing that same thing on a $25bn bond deal? Now it's a big deal. 
 So bankers play in a rigged system, where they're the smartest people in the room. Why can't we really stop them? Because the people we pay to stop them aren't even in the same league as them. Money talks, so given the choice between making $80,000 a year as a regulator or $250,000 as a banker, which would you choose? Me too. Banks also, as I may have mentioned, have lots of money. Regulators have strict budgets and limited resources. Banks attract the best and brightest talents in the field because they pay the best and offer the best opportunities. Consider that the top regulators might move on to become a CCO and make a few million dollars a year, after years of hard work and making less than other people of similar experience. Top bankers will be making millions more than them much earlier in their careers. Can't fault them for picking the lucrative route. 
 If you want to get mad about something, get mad at the system. Bankers are playing the game to get ahead, same as anyone else. The banking system has limited regulatory oversight, because regulators are Davids fighting against Goliaths. Banks get to socialize risk by being so big that they can't be allowed to fail (don't get me started on Living Wills, even if they do prevent another Bear/Lehman issue, they won't repay the billions in profits made in taking risks before they go under) and play in a market where they have serious information advantages. If you want to fix the system, you need to start at the system. Limit bank sizes, increase capital requirements (well beyond Basel, which is not nearly enough to cover exposures), limit total compensation (not bases or bonuses separately) and force banks to maintain their risky assets (and not just sell the exposure to other firms). How you'll get anyone to agree to this is beyond me, since this would need to be a global measure and not just US or Europe. Beyond that, how the rest of the world will handle losing access to near-limitless sources of money will be interesting, since this will almost certainly curb the rapid growth in economies that we've seen over the last 30-50 years. However, if you're going to take the stand that banks are a problem and need to be stopped, these are the realities we need to deal with.","Banks are a necessary evil for economic growth, and the current methods in place to stop bankers from making gobs of money are limited and ineffective. However, banks help facilitate lots of the things we do, and the current system lets people and companies do many great things for themselves. It's logical to hate the bankers, but you should understand that curtailing them will have a big impact on everyone else."

worldnews,c5j1kne,"The idea that the CIA's main source of revenue is to stop drug trafficking is silly. They are a government service provided to the people of the United States by the funding of the people of the United States and through the represented popular opinion of the people of the United States. If they ""finish the job"" there will be other jobs that they have the expertise to do. 
 The Fallacy of the Ending Job 
This idea that these organizations aren't truthfully working towards their goals doesn't make sense. There is no scenario where the CIA can ""solve"" the  simple  problem of drug trafficking, and then pack-up their things and apply for welfare. If in some hypothetical situation the CIA had the power to instantly remove all drug trafficking organizations from the equation, effectively stopping all drug trafficking globally, it would take only days for a replacement system to be established. There is much more change required in the world to ""stop"" the drug problem than prosecuting the organizations responsible for the supply chain of an illicit product. If you put the entire responsibility of tackling the issue of drugs on the shoulders of the CIA, then you'd expect them to alter cultural perspectives and norms, develop socio-economic equality, provide rehabilitation for addicts, and find feasible alternative employment for traffickers. All of this across multiple countries and through visibly different demographic populations. This can't be done by one nation's intelligence agency funded by a population that is largely absent from the conversation. So then it falls to multiple organizations with different levels, forms and frequencies of funding from different countries with different cultural perspectives to collaborate on solving the issue. 
 The Reality of the Problem 
The reality of the CIA's ""management"" of the drug trade seems entirely plausible. In fact, its what anyone who espouses the legalization and regulation of drugs is realistically going to get. A staple argument for legalization is that  ""It happens regardless, why don't we do our best to provide sober oversight to the process.""  Legalization wont obsolete the illegal organizations, but most likely bring them into the public eye alongside a few new upstarts. Then we can effectively remove organizations that want to continue killing and abusing labourers all the while rewarding organizations that behave properly with the ability to participate in the market. Currently the CIA's options are to continue the war of attrition on the drug cartels through the bureaucratic and arduous process of intelligence gathering, investigation, international criminal apprehension and lengthy trials; all while actively being combated by the local populations that harbour their targets, OR, try to influence the events in the drug trafficking industry in order to control the future outcomes. I can completely entertain a debate over what the CIA's role should be regarding drug trafficking. The debate comes down to ""Should the CIA be a body that aids in the apprehension, and prosecution of drug trafficking offenders."" or ""Should the CIA be a body that subverts and disrupts the organizations that facilitate drug trafficking"". This isn't a statement of their efficacy on either of those playing fields. Where things breakdown and become entirely unproductive is when logically flawed accusations start flying. 
 Exacerbating Factors 
Of course there will always be corruption in any organization, and that certainly hinders the ability of these organizations to do their job properly, but painting the entire organization by the brush of the corrupt doesn't lend itself to an accurate picture. In a similar breath, organizations like the CIA are certainly involved in some very blurry lined operations. The motives of which can and should be questioned; after all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. That said, this doesn't make them nefarious, colluding power mongers. 
 Conclusion 
I can understand the frustration of this Mexican official. It is really hard to make seemingly little progress while working with a team of apparently highly resourced partners. I think there can be a direct analogy with online gaming. Often times you are paired with people you've never met, with varying levels of skill and you are given an explicit goal. In reality each player wants a different outcome. One wants the most kills, another wants the highest score, others want a visibly spectacular match. Combine that with the fact that everyone comes to the table with a sense of self-righteousness and presumed superiority, you are bound to have conflict. So much so that when the player who pulls a spectacular stunt costs you a kill, you call him rather unsavoury things. In this case an official isn't seeing the outcomes they expect while working with a partner that is apparently of high calibre.

People were speaking based on the best knowledge they had and making assumptions on their experience. I have no experience with plants so all I could speak on was the ridiculousness of some of the things they media was saying.

worldnews,c45f0sy,"This article does not mention Clathrate gun hypothesis - some truly frightening shit. 
 My step dad is an environmental scientist, and he says that this is a real danger. once the oceans warm enough to melt these gas crystals, they will release massive levels of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere unlike anything we have seen during our soecies tenure on this planet. 
 >The clathrate gun hypothesis is the popular name given to the hypothesis that rises in sea temperatures (and/or falls in sea level) can trigger the sudden release of methane from methane clathrate compounds buried in seabeds and permafrost which, because the methane itself is a powerful greenhouse gas, leads to further temperature rise and further methane clathrate destabilization – in effect initiating a runaway process as irreversible, once started, as the firing of a gun.[1] 
 >In its original form, the hypothesis proposed that the ""clathrate gun"" could cause abrupt runaway warming in a timescale less than a human lifetime,[1] and might be responsible for warming events in and at the end of the last ice age.[2] This is now thought unlikely.[3][4] 
 >However, there is stronger evidence that runaway methane clathrate breakdown may have caused drastic alteration of the ocean environment and the atmosphere of earth on a number of occasions in the past, over timescales of tens of thousands of years; most notably in connection with the Permian extinction event, when 96% of all marine species became extinct 251 million years ago.[5] 
 >In 2008 the United States Department of Energy National Laboratory system[18] and the United States Geological Survey's Climate Change Science Program both identified potential clathrate destabilization in the Arctic as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change, which have been singled out for priority research. The USCCSP released a report in late December 2008 estimating the gravity of this risk.[19]","There are huge frozen greenhouse gas crystals on the ocean bed. As ocean temperatures rise to a certain tipping point, these crystals thaw and release unseen levels of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. This would be a point of no return, and while nobody is certain of the result, fossil record indicates that the possible extinction of most marine life at one point could have been due to this. Scary shit."

worldnews,cnvn2rn,"I've always been curious, how far does German teach about the Nazis 
 It's obviously a big part of history lessons. If you visit the Gymnasium (12 or 13 years) you will basically spend 2 years on the time between 1923 and 1949. In grade 9 you learn about Nazism the first time. And in grade 11 and/or 12 you discuss that time again and learn about it in more detail, with more gore and more personal responsibilities. 
 In grade 9 there is usually a field trip to one of the concentration camps. If you are lucky (unfortunately time is running out) a Holocaust Survivor visits and talks to class. 
 These are personal memories. And everything depends on the curriculum, which differs from state to state. And of course the teacher has a big part on the direction of the courses as well: 
 The overall point of these lessons was not to induce guilt, but to analyze the time and understand that democracy is very fragile and people are very receptive to propaganda. Hitler is not portrayed as the Pied Piper that lead the unwilling Germans to war and holocaust. There's quite an emphasis that regular german people participated because they wanted to participate. The point is that this could happen again, and everybody has to stay alert. 
So naturally a big part of the lessons is the situation that lead to the Machtergreifung (when Hitler became Chancellor). Propaganda, the Holocaust (and non-jewish victims), resistance movement, assassination attempts and war crimes (from all nations) are the most important points. The war itself is not as important, major theaters are mentioned in short, a few important battles are teached in more detail. At the end of the school year there was a bit on the allied POW-camps, Nuremberg trials, and the creation of the occupied zones. 
 The Pacific Ocean theater is only discussed very short. It's basically not much more than Japan is an axis member, Japan participated in the war, then there was Pearl Harbor (not many details) and the US dropped nuclear bombs which ended the war. I can't remember that I learned about anything else from that part of the world. To this day I don't know much about the war in the pacific ocean. 
 That's history lessons. In other classes Nazism is discussed when relevant as well. E.g. art classes (degenerate art), german (Anne Frank, Mein Kampf), social studies (elections, propaganda, our constitution) and religion (no idea) or ethics (the whole idea about responsibility, especially the ""should I feel guilty"" trope and the ""I was only following orders"", ""If I would not have done it, somebody else would have"", ""They would have killed me if I didn't participate"" excuses). 
 Disclaimer: I left school 13 years ago, I might have mixed up or forgot things.",Focus is on the things that lead to Hitler; the war crimes and that regular people were responsible as well. An important point was that Hitler and the war criminals were pretty much regular people and not monsters with magic powers that hypnotized the other Germans. And it's our responsibility to prevent that things like this happen again. Not much guilt was induced. But a lot of analysis and self reflection happened.

At least Russia has some good, 'excuses', if you would like to call them, to take actions upon Crimea, since it has had a deep relationship with the region, and part of Russia's history lies there, as well as there is indeed Russian people in that region, and many do prefer to anex to Russia, even though some of the peoole's views and decision were biased by other pro-Russians.

worldnews,c1dgod5,"They create wealth by being market makers for investments, the same way your local bank creates wealth by making markets for (among other items) getting loans. 
 When you need a house loan, or a business needs a loan to start or expand, they go to a bank for a loan. The bank knows people and entities with money to loan, and becomes a clearinghouse for those with capital they want to invest and those who want to borrow that capital. Each home buyer and business could try this on their own, but it would cost more since they are not specialists and experts in raising money. Thus the bank performs a service for each side that is cheaper for each side than if they did it directly.

If a borrower could get that loan cheaper through other means he/she should/would do so.

worldnews,clm030a,"Where to start out. 
 Firstly, evolution is not in itself sufficient to explain the existence of  life , merely the modifications life undergoes throughout the stages of its development. 
 If anything, evolution is a theory about the transformative processes life undergoes and the underlying principles involved. 
 So evolution therefore deals with life as its subject matter, but it cannot explain its cause or principle of origination. The evolutionists who therefore think that evolution is a satisfactory explanation for the existence of life, are effectively holding the position that me putting toast in the toaster was what produced the bread in the first place. It may represent an instance of the logical fallacy 'affirmation of the consequent', but I am not entirely certain. 
 So yeah, evolution can explain the transformative principles of life. But not why life itself exists. 
 There is a fairly popular theory bandied about by a good few Christian sects. It is present in other religions as well [namely, Hinduism.] The basic idea is that physical explanations rely and depend on physical causes. Which is at heart the principle of causation: Effects are dependent upon causes. Any physical explanation can therefore be validly challenged, because it does not produce an absolute answer to the question. 
 This is phrased by modern philosophy in a more robust way: Roughly speaking, temporal entities are contingent in nature, because they have a somewhat relative existence. It is possible that one could cease to exist at this point in time, therefore, ones existence is a contingent fact. This seems to be a problem though, because in logical terms, we can't formulate any sound explanation without evoking an infinite chain of regression. 
 Taken simply, we may ask: Why was I born? Because of my parents. Why were they born? Because of their parents. Why were they born? etc. This line of questioning may go on infinitely, without ever arriving at an actual answer. From which we may infer the principle that:  There is no physical explanation that is sufficient to fully account for physical causation. 
 [Interestingly, it is said in Hindu mythology that when Buddha attained to Nirvana he was given knowledge by the Gods of the nature of causation. Understanding the nature of causation was in itself part and parcel of enlightenment. Ancient Hinduism was extremely advanced in both the content and richness of its philosophy, and the rigorousness of its logical systems. They had nailed conditional propositions way before the West had fully formulated them.] 
 On account of the inherent unsoundness of physical explanations therefore, God is the given alternative. God represents a sound ontological basis for any and all things. 
 To tie it all in, evolutionists who state that said theory can do away with the notion of God are entirely wrong. Firstly because evolution is not a theory about the origination of life [which it is, most of the time, taken to be by many morons on reddit who expound scientism without a whiff of rigorous thinking about them.] Secondly, because science itself cannot explain the universe. In order to not be contradictory by making use of supernatural causes, science absolutely  must  refer to physical causes in order to explain things. But in so doing, it must necessarily accept all the weaknesses inherent in the cause/effect paradigm. As soon as supernatural causes make their way onto the scene, science loses a massive chunk of its validity. 
 What can be drawn from the above? Well, firstly that science can never do away with God. Its realm of explanation is limited to the physical one. It may propose alternative explanations, and these taken in conjunction with naive psychological observations may appear [appear being the main word here] to constitute sound arguments in themselves... Unfortunately, they never really are. For example, I see a great many redditors using some kind of argument that the Church is about money and personal gain, therefore, religion is a lie. At the very least, this is an argument against organised religion. On the other hand, you must ask yourself - If these people are as egoistically driven as you say, are they  actually  religious? Almost every religion concerns itself with ethics, among other things. And said ethics are almost entirely concerned with self-denial, compassion, charity and forgiveness. Does the argument do what you think it does? It does not. 
 Anyway, that's my ramble.","Evolution is a theory about the transformative principles of life. It cannot explain the origination of life, since the theory itself presupposes it. No evolution without life. Scientific explanations depend on physical causes. Physical causes are epistemologically flawed. Science cannot explain away God. Hindu mythology very lofty and philosophically advanced - It dismissed exhaustive physical explanations, materialism and annihilationism out of hand. 
 Edit 2: In one Hindu work [I forget which] a sage is teaching a king [or a king his servant, I forget which.] Hindu metaphysics invoked the notion of five elements, much like Aristotle did. The sage asks: 'Did the self originate with fire? Did the self originate with earth? Did the self originate with water? Did the self originate with air? Did the self originate with aether?'. Eventually the sage and the king agree that the self arose from that which has no self. We may see that the Indians had already developed a form of the scientific method and rigorously applied it to philosophy. We may also perceive that Hindu mythology had already understood the metaphysical problems underlying scientific theories, and  found a way around them  by focusing not on the development of one's interactions with immediate external objects which only had a relative value to us as beings, but on the permanent self on which one's physical existence was grounded, namely, one's soul. 
 A lot of people claim that the advance of science represents the progress of humanity, to which I will respond that many cultures [like the Ancient Indians] saw the physical world as being the lowest mode of existence. It assisted in promoting desire, which had a negative effect on one's Karma. One would pay for ones transgressions through periodic remanifestation on the wheel of life - Over-involvement with the physical world was ultimately bad for one's soul... They were far more concerned with spiritual development, the developing of themselves, than of concernment with their immediate surroundings. For an example, let's take the aforementioned ascension of Buddha to Nirvana as an example. He was given an understanding of physical causation  as a whole , which would necessitate an understanding of the nature of every single possible cause. Make of that what you will :p"

 People forget just how fucking  HUGE  the US military is. Currently, the USS George HW Bush is parked in the Pursian Gulf. It alone, carries 40-48 F/A-18s, and in just 1 deployment during Operation Enduring Freedom, they dropped over 59,000 lbs of explosives. That's just 1 ship. There's also Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, the RAFO Thumrait base in Oman, Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE, Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Sheik Isa Air Base in Bahrain, Isa Air Base in Saudi Arabia... There's hundreds of bombers, multiroles, fighters, and CAS jets alone in that region. There's probably another naval flat top in the region as well, though more than likely it's just an amphib, but Harriers are more than capable of bombing as well. There's honestly probably more US air power in that region, than there is host nation air power... Striking targets around Kobane isn't even going to cause a noticable tempo increase for those forces, so there's no reason why striking targets around Kobane would of lessened the resources available to the US. 
 The thing is, Iraq's a different case than Kobane. The US didn't want to leave Iraq, because it was unstable, but Iraqi leadership forced us out. Now, their military has openly stated they won't fight without US troops beside them, but their government still openly rejects the notion of allowing any US personnel in that region, which even covers special forces that help guide the strikes. Northern Iraq is an autonomous region, and Baghdad has no real authority there, so as long as the Kurds agree to it, we can be there, which is why special forces are there, helping guide strikes against ISIS. 
 Without allowing  any  US ground forces in southern Iraq, the Iraqi government is preventing any increase of strikes against ISIS around Baghdad. We can use drones/satellites to try and spot ISIS' forces there, but satellites can take days to get into the right location, and even then, might not get a good shot of what you want, and drones wouldn't even help, as the attacks ISIS used on those bases, isn't like the attack they've waged on Kobane. Kobane was a massive ISIS campaign... tanks, APCs, artillery... the bases around Baghdad were simply a few suicide bombers to penetrate the perimeter, and then some ISIS fighters to flood in.","ISIS' methods were completely different between the 2, and Iraq' goverment limit's the US' ability to conduct strikes.

worldnews,cdkcqt1,"A lot of what your saying is unfounded hearsay that completely exemplifies the shitty thought process behind the Cold War that brought the world so close to the brink of destruction. 
 The Cold War can be thought of as a series of constant miscommunication leading to military/political escalation. The USSR  wasn't  expanding their influence as much as they could- that only happened after the US upped their ante. 
 In reality, what the USSR was initially doing during and post-WWII was creating a buffer zone around itself- Russia has had a history of invasions that have caused significant damage, and the Eastern Bloc was meant to act as a barrier to invasion. 
 In fact, the man responsible for basically kicking off the Cold War was George Keenan, who worked at the US Embassy in Moscow and sent something called ""The Long Telegram""  back to Washington, which basically stated the incompatibility of capitalism and communism while highlighting the faults of Soviet society, and suggesting the necessity of containment of Communism. The Long Telegram would eventually be published as Article X and form the framework for US foreign policy for much of the Cold War. 
 This is pretty much the source of anti-communist opinions that would shape the world to this day and what's especially funny is that George Keenan later stated that he felt he was misunderstood, and never thought that the USSR would ever attack the US, and that he was in fact suggesting political containment, not military.","The alternative to the Cold War could possible have been much better- Kennan, the original ""author"" of containment, suggested Capitalism should inevitably win over Communism by being a shining example of human success, and that military containment arose due to post-WWII fears and a misinterpretation of a sentence."

 You can get clever and fiddle with your corporate structure such that money is moved between subsidiaries, creatively offset against expenses or shuffled through various financial instruments, and as long as you don't actually break the law (merely take advantage of the loopholes that the tax code and corporate law is  absolutely riddled  with) then you'll be fine.  The law is so complicated and has so many loopholes because the institution has been around for hundreds of years, and politicians have been meddling with it and introducing exceptions into it for personal, corporate or other economic advantage for pretty much the whole time it's existed.

At  best  you may be able to spend millions going to court to question the legality of the order (and these days often in a secret court, with no accountability, under a gag order, where the government doesn't even have to play fair and you're hamstrung by various ""national security"" exemptions from basic fair judicial process), but there's no guarantee you'll win, and in the political climate since 9/11 judges have a troubling tendency to rule in favour of the government, even when their actions explicitly breach both the letter and spirit of the law. 
 This is because most of these laws are very new, were modified or entirely replaced in the wake of 9/11 when the Congressional mood was - broadly - ""fuck privacy and individual rights - someone just fucking  attacked  us!"", were drafted in a tearing hurry and rammed through before cooler heads prevailed and people started worrying too much about potential consequences, and  the entire aim of the laws was to maximise the amount of information the government could acquire  and to  minimise or eradicate  any and all loopholes that might prevent them.

worldnews,ca2yl8v,"You don't screen for testicular cancer, you screen for prostate cancer at 40 (and they recently adjusted those guidelines).  Copied from USPSTF: 
 The low incidence of testicular cancer and favorable outcomes in the absence of screening make it unlikely that clinical testicular examinations would provide important health benefits. Clinical examination by a physician and self-examination are the potential screening options for testicular cancer. However, little evidence is available to assess the accuracy, yield or benefits of screening for testicular cancer. 
 Although currently most testicular cancers are discovered by patients themselves or their partners, either unintentionally or by self-examination, there is no evidence that teaching young men how to examine themselves for testicular cancer would improve health outcomes, even among men at high risk, including men with a history of undescended testes or testicular atrophy. 
 Clinicians should be aware of testicular cancer as a possible diagnosis when young men present to them with suggestive signs and symptoms. There is some evidence that patients who present initially with symptoms of testicular cancer are frequently diagnosed as having epididymitis, testicular trauma, hydrocele, or other benign disorders. Efforts to promote prompt assessment and better evaluation of testicular problems may be more effective than widespread screening as a means of promoting early detection.","Basically the idea is to get people to come to the doctor with their lumps and bumps, rather than getting doctors to feel your balls regularly."

worldnews,ca19mef,"Here is the  2012 Arctic Report Card . These articles only detail what has happened in 2012; they don't throw in political bias or infer suggestions for consumers, so they are beneficial in that sense (but it doesn't mean they are necessarily perfect; I'm sure you'd be able to find more detailed projection pieces elsewhere). Personally I think this is one of the better pieces about what is happening in the Arctic due to climate change. 
 Since there are many topics discussed in this conglomeration of papers, I suggest focusing on Greenhouse Gases, Sea Ice, and the Greenland Ice Sheet. These three topics include some of the most significant changes of our time, and almost all of that is projected to be a result of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Sea ice recession as well as the Greenland Ice Sheet's recent large scale melting is a clear depiction of what is happening up north, illustrating clearly that there is definitely something influencing cryosphere systems as we haven't seen before in our own lifetimes. I should take this moment to note though that sea ice melt does not raise sea levels; sea level rise is affected largely by thermal expansion as well as terrestrial ice melt. I make a point to state this because many people do in fact make that mistake, and such mistakes can affect one's understanding of global climate change and its results. 
 Climate change can for sure be complicated; there are many systems involved, both human and otherwise. I'll try to give you a rundown of what I know, though I have my own biases as a northern college student who learned much of this information in a class about Arctic systems, so look at me as critically as you please. I will also try to link as many sources as I can, but obviously I can't give you everything on the topic, so feel free to use your own resources to try to find evidence (try to stick to empirical articles though, and always check out the authors/publishers, so you can better parse out political agendas or other biases). 
 Greenhouse gas emissions have increased significantly ever since the industrial revolution. The most important greenhouse gas to know is carbon dioxide; it has the longest residence time of all greenhouse gases (it can remain in the atmosphere, or other body, for about 50-200 years) and currently has the largest concentration of the gases, which may be at about 373 ppm (this data is taken from a lecture slide, and so may have been updated). Methane and water vapor also serve as influential greenhouse gases. What these gases do is essentially trap infrared radiation from our sun, causing the lower atmosphere and the Earth's surface to warm. In the Arctic, there are actually large stores of carbon in the soil, held by frozen permafrost. As these areas warm, this gas can be further released into the atmosphere. This is the basic ""cause"" of global warming as is widely known, but it by no means is the only factor in our Earth's warming and climate alterations. 
 Sea ice and snow cover serve to cool the Earth substantially; they are the most reflective natural surfaces on the planet. This means that they have the highest albedo; the most potential to reflect solar radiation. The natural surface with the lowest albedo is the open ocean; it has the most potential to absorb solar radiation. Thus, a feedback loop is created as the Earth warms. With higher temperatures, snow and ice recede, leaving surfaces with lower albedo. These surfaces will absorb the sun's energy, and in turn cause further heating, resulting in less snow and less ice, and so on and so forth. This is known as a ""positive feedback loop"" as the effect amplifies itself. In this way (as well as with other systems) the Arctic sees the most dramatic effects of climate change and also influencing the Earth's global climate. Since the Arctic is being altered the most, it is often referred to as the ""canary in the coal mine"". It isn't just an indicator though; the ice and snow from the north and their changes are having their own influences on the whole world. Greenland's massive ice sheet recently experienced a melting event in which almost the entire continent experienced some level of melting; if this terrestrial ice were to melt away, not only would albedo decrease but sea level rise would also occur substantially. Not to mention all of the animals that would be affected by shifting ecosystems. 
 There is much more to understand about the Earth's systems and how they have been changing due to greenhouse gases and climate change, and you can find out a lot from many different organizations, so I won't take up too much more space or time with information. The important things to note are that infrastructure for northern cities is already beginning to feel the effects of melted permafrost and warming, sea ice reduction is hurting both the Earth's climate as well as marine and terrestrial ecosystems (there is a lot of information concerning polar bears and their decline, despite efforts to keep them from the endangered species list), indigenous populations are having to adapt their hunting techniques and traveling techniques due to thinner and sparser ice formations, and global temperature increases have definitively been recorded. I hope this was enough for you to be convinced, sorry for the huge novel.

worldnews,caguwxl,"The “nothing to hide” argument is a difficult one. It makes sense, but only if you do not take time to think about it. Why do we then bother to wear clothes? And what about Nazi Germany? How would this argument have supported the fascistic cause? Could history be repeating itself again? 
 In his book IBM and the Holocaust the investigative journalist Edwin Black details the business dealing of the American-based multinational corporation International Business Machines and its Germany and other European subsidiaries with the government of Adolf Hitler during the 1930’s and the years of World War II. In the book, Black outlines the way in which IBM’s technology helped to facilitate Nazi genocide through the generation and tabulation of punch cards based upon national census data. 
 Hitler came to power in January 1933 and repression against political opponents and the country's substantial ethnic Jewish population began at once. By April 1933, some 60,000 had been imprisoned. On April 12, 1933, the German government announced the plans to immediately conduct a long-delayed national census. The project was particularly important to the Nazis as a mechanism for the identification of Jews, Gypsies and other ethics groups deemed undesirable by the regime. 
 IBM owned 90% of its German subsidiary which was know as Dehomag and through it offered to actively assist the German government in its task of ethnic identification, concentrating first on the 41 million citizens of Prussia. 
 In October 1933 IBM’s chairman Thomas Watson traveled to Germany and immediately ramped up IBM’s investment in its German subsidiary from 400 000 to 7 000 000 reichsmark (about $1 million). This enabled Dehomag to purchase land in Berlin and construct IBM’s first factory in Germany thereby tooling up for what it correctly saw as a massive financial relationship with the Hitler regime. 
 From the aforesaid it is clear that the “nothing to hide argument” is dangerous in its own right. A government, under the auspices of a census, asks its citizens to indicate their religious affiliation and surely that is nothing to hide, right? Then later that government uses the American advances in technology to identify and persecute those with the “wrong” religious affiliation. 
 It is admittedly a bit extreme to compare America with Nazi Germany, but I am sure you get the point – what is innocent and acceptable today, may not be so tomorrow and how do you then retract or hide your affiliations?

But the coup in Iran was completely created by foreign players, there was no serious talk of coup until Kermit Roosevelt and his team started planning, unlike the protest and crackdown that followed any talk of international involvement. You  could  argue that the protest were the result of NATO machinations but rebels seem to be equally made up of everyday citizens along with disgruntled generals and politicians. The Iranian coup was largely carried out by a handful of soldiers and military officers. 
 Also Mossedegh was in the process of nationalizing the countries oil which would greatly cut into BP's (yes,  that  BP) profits, the company that pretty much had full control of Iran's oil and would pay rent on the wells. It was a really shitty deal for the Iranians as 70+ percent of the profits were leaving the country and the money that stayed in was largely going to individuals that appeased the British oil industry. 
 From my understanding, Gaddafi cut some pretty rad deals with western oil companies in the last few decades, especially in Europe so its not like there was oil the west wasn't getting their hands on, in fact, I would argue that NATO countries were putting a lot the line by providing air support to this spontaneous and haphazard rebellion if oil was the chief concern. 
 I have doubts about the legitimacy of this article as the NTC said just Monday that they would ""honor all existing oil contracts"" as-is (even from countries that were either neutral or supported Gaddafi). I don't know what percentage of Oil goes to France already but 35% seems more like the number for all Oil exports to Europe that already exist, so some contracts would have to be switched around if France was to get a better deal. 
 IMHO the first real test of how stable the NTC is will be how they assimilate the Gaddafi Regime, like if it will be near seamless or if there will be Chzek style witchhunts for years to come. 
 edit:",The Iranian coup was based around suspicions of socialism combined with the fear of Western Big Oil loosing their very severe monopoly on Iranian oil that were essentially scamming the Iranian government for their benefit. No such crisis was at risk in Libya.

 In fact many people, myself included, would love to see some logging allowed on conserved state and federal land around here. Once a forest gets past a certain age it actually tends to support less of many types of wildlife. Many creatures rely on forest disturbances, and even creatures that rely on big chunks of woods often benefit when a specific area is cut down and allowed to regenerate. Deer numbers are extremely low on most national forest here, and moose numbers actually seem to be dropping as well in many areas because the forest is too old.

 In that year we had two wars going, one understandable, one totally illegal and immoral, disastrously managed and a republican party in complete denial, instead choosing to go after illegal immigrants and gay people as their ""get out the vote issues"" in order to keep their vision going. Bigots lines up behind them in support. 
 They took John Kerry, a decorated Vietnam vet who won 3 purple hearts, returned to protest the war in congress as the leader of an antiwar group, a guy who worked across the isle with many moderate republicans like McCain, McConnell and Luger. A guy who had been a seasoned vet and negotiator in the senate and was a member of the senate foreign relations committee. They took all those strengths, strengths that Bush didn't have and made up a total fabrication that was debunked and is now known as ""swiftboating"" someone. Squeaking the narrowest victory in the history of the country. 
 The American public took a look at Bush, a man who has never worked in his life, a ""good ole country boy""....who grew up in Connecticut, who had never so much as left the country other than a vacation in Mexico, a ....""normal guy you'd have a beer with""..... who's dad was President, VP, head of the CIA ambassador to China,  who's grandfather Prescott bush, a man who prescribed to eugenics, was buddies with Rockefeller and funded much of his fathers political ambitions. They took a look at Bush, a failed oil man who loved baseball, who got elected by supreme court vote,  fucked up every single safe guard protecting our country, 9/11 had a republican President, governor and Mayor when it happened. They examined the facts about Bushes DUI, his known cocaine use and half-ass service in the military. Halliburton, Blackwater, his total inability to speak coherently, embarrassing the country worldwide when meeting with other world leaders, his disastrous loss to Kerry in the first debate...... 
 They looked at the these two men, and thought ""this Bush guy should be reelected""

Because the amount of wealth being transferred from the pockets of everyday Americans to the rich was going to be protected, this wasn't about  ""hey lets fuck over poor people because we're evil puppy kicking republicans""  like liberals often make them out to be, this was far more sinister, this was Cheney, George SR, George JR,Halliburton,Boeing,and Blackwater (remember them? the private military?) teaming up to create unrest, raise oil prices and pilfer trillions from untapped markets, markets that should have been protected. (remember the color terror alert system??) In 2004 the Republican party, or those in the top spots for the first time in the history of the United States, did not have the best interests of the country at heart. they were concerned with themselves and their funders.

 More likely, people knew more about bones because:

 >2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,141 tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""142 They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved. 
 >2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial.  They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity . Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.

worldnews,ciaplch,"Whenever a discussion about one voting scheme being better than another comes up, people usually compare single-winner to single-winner voting schemes. 
 But in my opinion, the multiple-winner vs. single-winner distinction is a lot more important. Or in other words, if a country allows for having multiple (e.g. 5, 7 or 11) presidents, with some sort of proportional representation, and all the presidents have to vote (instead of a single president just deciding), that would solve a ton of problems that every single-voting system has, namely, that somehow, somewhere, the voting process fucked up and now you're stuck with a megalomaniac idiot that no one really wanted. 
 Sure, you might end up with most of the ""presidents"" being megalomaniac cunts, but it's a lot less likely, and even if it does happen, there's a chance that they'd keep each other in check due to infighting. 
 Plus instead of a system where a president is either left or right wing since there's only 2 parties, a collective of presidents promotes having more parties (since if your party ""loses"", it doesn't have to be a total loss) as well as leading to a more balanced process of policy making. 
 At least chances are lower for ALL the right wing members being right-wing hardliners/left wing members being left wing hardliners, so chances of a right wing majority voting for a left wing policy or vice versa aren't necessarily higher, but more evenly distributed. As in, instead of having a moderate president that actually makes compromises for 4 years followed by a hardliner that never compromises, making compromises/more moderate policies would happen more often/more evenly spread throughout the years.","It's not so much how you vote for a ruler, but rather about  how many rulers you vote for."

The population doesn't have to choose between those two candidates, they can choose anyone they want, but generally people choose one of the two parties, generally because they believe that those representatives represent their interests best.  Keep in mind, also, that those campaigning are chosen for their spot in the party through a heavily democratic (although admittedly not entirely democratic) process--the Republic party doesn't just choose some corrupt senator and go ""vote for him or else"", the representative needs to win popular support in the primaries.

 The United States already use prison labor heavily. From military gear to furniture, prisoners make plenty of things for tiny wages, about 30 cents to a dollar per hour. And they can't just decide not to work, they are  required  to work if able. That's  forced labor . American prisons only differ from gulags in that there's more people in them. One might wonder if, considering how convenient this is for the economy, some people might be fine with people getting imprisoned on trivial charges like drug possession.

Prisoners are already imprisoned, forcing them to work is nothing but a different kind of slavery, justified through revenge (which is what most people think of as a prison).

worldnews,c3znp3p,"Except you are partially, partially wrong... So don't take this as an offense. 
 The Armenian Genocide was a religious and nationalistic conflict. A religious war by Kurdish and Turkish locals in the region. A nationalistic war by Armenian rebels. Hundreds of thousands of lives were lost on both sides. 
 A lot of the conflict has more to do with the [rise of Armenian nationalism]( inspired by the [Balkan war 1912 successes against the Ottoman Empire]( and by Russian sphere of influence in the region. [Creating a huge Armenian rebellion across the East and Russian invasion of Turkey.]( 
 This prompted the Ottoman government to relocate Armenians in Eastern Turkey, to Syrian Ottoman territory. In the midst of World War I, where Armenian-Russian forces were marching toward central Turkey and rebel Armenian forces inside Turkey were sabotaging supply lines and telegraph lines. 
 [Many Armenians were allowed to return after Russia withdrew from the war]( Many Armenians held high government positions. So there was no Ottoman hatred of Armenians as they lived in peace for 700-800 years. 
 Western Armenians were exempt from relocations, because they were not a rebel threat. Most Armenians who were arrested or tried, were actually associated with the ARF rebel group. 
 [Many Turkish soldiers were tried by Ottoman authorities, for failing to protect Armenian citizens]( or involving themselves in the local ethnic / nationalistic / religious conflict with Armenians. 
 Yes, you are right, Muslim Turks in local conflicts involved themselves in fights with Armenian locals and Armenian rebel groups. Much blood was shed. 
 However, this doesn't sound like much of a genocide, but it was more of a failed attempt at suppressing the Armenian rebellion in the midst of World War I when the Ottomans were short on supplies, short on money, and being attacked by 3 different European powers. It sounds more like a desperate attempt by a failed Ottoman empire to try to restore order in a war zone that is quickly looking like a lost cause. They were the sick man of Europe and losing every single war. 
 A lot of Armenians, Kurds, and Turks died in this lawless region due to the starvation and disease and heavy food shortages associated with World War I. 
 However, there was no clear intent of genocide, as the intent was clear and evidenced in the Holocaust. Many Ottoman governors and [Ottoman officials were aiding the Armenians during these tough times as even US archival records show.]( 
 The war continued after in the Turkish independence war, and once the European powers were tired of dealing with this region, they abandoned their allies the Armenians in 1919, and Armenia established its independence more Eastward then they had hoped. 
 The Armenians tried hard in the Paris Peace Conference to prove how much the Armenian rebel armies contributed to World War I Entente forces. They tried their best to ask for more aid and territory from the victory over the central powers (includes Ottomans). There they documented how much damage they did to the Ottoman war effort and how widespread their rebellion truly was. Essentially proving that the Ottoman action to relocate them was quite necessary in order for them to not be defeated in the war.","I will probably be downvoted because most people don't study the history of this region, they just listen to whatever they've heard and for decades Armenians living in English-speaking countries have had a nationalistic goal of convincing everyone that this was a terrible genocide and avoided taking any blame for their part in World War I and they hid their complicity in the violent ethnic cleansing of Muslims from Eastern Turkey by their rebel armies. This religious-nationalistic hatred by Armenians has convinced a lot of people to hate the Turks and believe in the many exaggerations about this dark chapter in history.

worldnews,chtgf7n,"One reason is because of something known as the [Juror's Oath]( If selected to serve on a jury, you must swear an oath that you will judge the case  based on only the evidence presented at trial. 
 Remember that when you are on a jury, you do not know the particulars of the case beforehand, and do not know what evidence will or will not be presented at trial. When you are selected to serve on a jury, you are essentially swearing a ""blank check"" oath on a case you know nothing about beforehand to base your decision on only the evidence presented at trial, agreeing to forgo your own moral belief structure. 
 Here is an example - say you are selected and sworn onto a jury and the case turns out to be about some 18-year-old kid who was caught with a bunch of marijuana - no violence involved, just weed possession. If you live in a state with mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for possession, you may have to send that person to jail for 10 years because the evidence shows they are indeed guilty, and you have already sworn an oath to judge the case on evidence alone (which you have to do to get on the jury in the first place), even though morally you in no way agree with the sentencing and personally consider it to be situation where the mandatory punishment is going to dramatically outweigh the crime. 
 In that example I outlined above, you are then forced to chose between exercising your right to nullify the verdict or upholding the law by adhering only to the evidence presented at trial, but if you chose to nullify, that means that you are now ignoring an oath you have already SWORN to uphold. Some people don't care about oaths and have no problem lying when they swear to one, but some do care. I am one for example who cares a lot about an oath and what it means to swear to something, and I will not swear to something ahead of time (a ""blank check"" oath) without knowing what I am swearing to or about. 
 If you are a believer in the concept of juror nullification and accept that your personal morals  may  supersede the law of the land  if  you disagree with the law (which is why the right to nullification exists), you have an absolute moral duty to make that fact known to the court BEFORE you swear an oath that you will adhere only to the evidence presented at trial when rendering your verdict - a trial remember that you know nothing about the particulars of beforehand. 
 So the","is, you can avoid jury duty because first and foremost, you respect your own personal moral belief structure ahead of ANYTHING else, and will not swear beforehand to adhere to evidence you will only be learning about in the future during the trial."

 >In June 2004, the Los Angeles Times will report that, according to some 9/11 Commission members and US counterterrorism officials, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia cut secret deals with the Taliban and bin Laden before 9/11. These deals date to this year, if not earlier, and will successfully shield both countries from al-Qaeda attacks until long after 9/11. 
 Main article - 
 
 >Significantly, Sheikh is also the man who, on the instructions of General Mahmoud Ahmed, the then head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), wired $100,000 before the 9/11 attacks to Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker. It is extraordinary that neither Ahmed nor Sheikh have been charged and brought to trial on this count. 
 
 >The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found “incontrovertible evidence” that Saudi government officials — not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers employed by the kingdom — helped the hijackers both financially and logistically. 
 
 >Qadi remains a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist"" under U.S. law. 
 >According to their own business plan for Ptech’s 1999 contract with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Ptech software team began working two years prior to 9/11 to identify potential problems or weaknesses in the FAA’s emergency response plans.[75] 
 >Specifically, Ptech was paid by the Federal Aviation Administration to find weaknesses in the FAA’s response plans for events like the terrorist hijacking of a plane over U.S. airspace.

 >Yesterday we noted a report from a Pakistani newspaper that Lt. Gen. Mahmud Ahmad had been fired as head of Islamabad's Inter-Services Security agency after U.S. linked him to a militant allied with terrorists who hijacked an Indian Airlines plane in 1999. Now the Times of India says Ahmad is connected to the Sept. 11 attacks:
Top sources confirmed here on Tuesday, that the general lost his job because of the ""evidence"" India produced to show his links to one of the suicide bombers that wrecked the World Trade Centre. The US authorities sought his removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 were wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh at the instance of General Mahumd. 
 >Senior government sources have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief. While they did not provide details, they said that Indian inputs, including Sheikh's mobile phone number, helped the FBI in tracing and establishing the link. 
 
 >Guantanamo documents name Pakistan ISI as al Qaeda associate 
 
 >Osama bin Laden, the founder and head of the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011 
 
 >The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 
 
 Everything related to the FBI before 9/11 should be taken into account through FBI whistle blower Sibel Edmonds who can be read about here.

They are targeting major cities, big metropolitan cities; they think four or five cities; New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, and San Francisco; possibly Los Angeles or Las Vegas. They will use airplanes to carry out the attacks. They said that some of the individuals involved in carrying this out are already in the United States.

worldnews,c1b67v1,"I'd like to add some remarks to the article, as my knowledge of the issue and my opinion. In the article Robert Kushen says that the situation of Roma should not be considered as an issue of the EU, but as that of the countries where Gypsies primarily live. This is wrong on two sides. The western states are responsible for the geographical distribution of the Gypsy ethnicity. That is, in the middle ages, Gypsies were driven (beaten to death if they didn't) out of western countries, and their allowed stay in eastern Europe was a kind of a compromise between eastern and western states. So to say something like Kushen said, that ""this country should be responsible for the situation of the Gypsy ethnicity, but not the EU as a whole"", forgets the historical responsibility of the west. 
 The second one is that of recent history. Socialism (or communism as was called) which ended 20 years ago was a very wasteful system (corrupt too, but thats another matter), but it did provide for the poorest social classes, and provided some employment to the Gypsies. The industry in east Europe was taken over (relatively cheaply) by western multinational companies, which were not obliged to employ (the uneducated) Gypsies, they only needed educated, but still cheap labor force. The non-employment of the Gypsy population is showing its price now, which must be paid by someone. 
 The title of the post is somewhat misleading. The ""Right Wing"" party is the Jobbik, which is an opposition party, not the governing party. The EU presidency is held by Hungary under the Fidesz government, which a center-right party, with more leftist voters than the Hungarian Socialists.","Its not just sane to help the situation of Gypsies in eastern Europe by the west, but it is its historical responsibility too."

worldnews,c8pewa7,"In exactly what sense are they a drain? 
 Social services?  Bullshit.  If Denmark's social welfare system has an ounce of thought behind it, it doesn't provide free services to foreigners, at least not unless they pay. 
 Private goods?  again, people still need to pay their way, no matter how much stuff they consume, weather that stuff is food, clothing, or anything else. 
 Public services? You might think it's a total steal for them, as military/roads/police/fire/other public services by nature serve everyone in the area.  However, this in-excludability is exactly the benefit.  It costs practically the same amount or less per capita to provide public services to more people in a given area, because of favorable economies of scale.  Obviously for military/defense, additional customers have no marginal cost.  Roads may be more congested, but those are offset naturally by high gas taxes in denmark, or they are simply not used if the immigrants cant afford them.  Civic administration and zoning deals with property, which immigrants rarely own.  Police may have slightly more work to do, but as long as the immigrants are working jobs and paying some level of taxes it's more than paid for. 
 Suppressing the labor market?  Of course when more workers compete for fewer jobs, the going wage rate goes down.  If everyone works anyway, prices would fall as well, and the result would be deflation, and the purchasing power of the worker doesn't change, as long as all labor is utilized.  Of course this doesn't happen 100% efficiently or instantly; in every economy factors of production are constantly changing to reflect supply and demand, so that in the long term, people tend to organize capital structures the best they can, while minimizing the temporary inefficiencies during the transition.  So adjusting the economy to incorporate more workers, from an economic perspective, is no different in principle from adjusting to a higher or lower supply of steel or gasoline or anything else, which happens all the time without even most people noticing 99% of the time. We don't try to pass laws telling the energy markets to slow down or keep supplies constant, why should we do the same for labor?  Should human beings be  more  free than large quantities of steel? 
 The one point I will concede that immigrants, to any country, are a drain is in the domain of culture.  Domestic cultures can be enriched, but can also be displaced when foreigners flood in in sufficient numbers.  I accept this.  But I would ask you: what is the meaning of national culture?  What is the significance of the association between any favored set of beliefs, practices, shared narratives, and ideals, and an arbitrarily given plot of land?  All nations are such.  Shared history should not be needed for any proper civil government, because an ideal government should transcend the biases of any one perspective.  Beliefs are (or should be) similarly irrelevant; any just political system tolerates any and all beliefs and peaceful religious practices.  No number of new people with different views should pose any threat to governments that are legitimately worth defending.  Beyond the purposes of preserving the legal order, domestic culture doesn't need anyone's permission to continue.  People will always be free to speak their own language, practice their own customs, and observe any celebrations they want.  Majorities are not necessary for any culture to survive, a majority is only operative when the culture is expressed in government policy, which shouldn't be necessary. 
 Language, on the other hand, could in theory be displaced by the speech of immigrants, but this is such a profound and extreme kind of cultural transformation that it only really occurs when the population doubles or more due to a single linguistic group, which is nowhere near the situation Denmark is in.  At worst they would grow by perhaps 10% from speakers of several languages.  When everyone else is still speaking Danish, immigrants don't need to be told twice to learn it.",Immigrants do not drain society in any way that matters unless they commit actual crimes.

I's not that feeding starving people is a bad thing, it's just that isn't what the product is actually used for. Corn, soy, cotton, canola, etc, are not feeding starving people. They are just used to deal with some of the problems with large scale agribusiness and monoculture, chemical fertilizers, soil loss, etc. And yes, sure, the technology could be used to engineer crops that can grow in more arid regions like Africa and India, for example. But even then, the issue isn't really the availability of strains that are already capable of growing in arid regions (since numerous strains already exist), it is constraints placed upon the poorest of these regions by geopolitics, wars, etc. In other words, it isn't an issue of farmers starving because of their crops failing, it's an issue with obscenely poor people who don't even have land to grow food on.",It's not about starving people in the 3rd world.

worldnews,c5plysq,"Great response.  I have some expertise in deep marine sediment biogeochemistry and microbiology.  Thing is, the ocean is a really big place and black smokers are ALREADY dishing out tons of heavy metals etc into the water, causing hydrothermal plumes that precipitate out over many miles.  In particular there are already bacteria and archaea in the water that love oxidizing metals to get energy, and typically oxidized metals are not soluble and so precipitate out.  The ocean itself is a buffer, which would dampen acidifying effects of metal oxidation, while it is being diluted away.
And btw, the mercury poisoning one can get from high-foodchain marine life is partly natural but also a lot due to industrial mercury pollution, particularly from coal burning.  That impacts the atmosphere and surface layer and is a much bigger input than deepwater mining would be. 
 However I'd dispute the geologist guy's assertion about not being much fish at 1000m (although he's correct most biomass is above that layer).  1000m is the base of the wind-driven circulation layer, which might mean that different currents slide past each other about there, which might mean density differences, which means food for  organisms  as deepwater reefs; the communities that spring up around black smokers are already used to rapid change as the hydrothermal plumbing changes and so would be able to adapt to harvesting.","This needs to be monitored, but it shouldn't be prevented outright, it's probably much less environmentally problematic than open pit mining-check out what happened in [Butte, Montana]("

worldnews,ccmw8xq,"It's not a religious dispute, though that does play a large role in nationalist narratives on both sides; it's a political dispute, a clash between Zionists versus Arab and Palestinian nationalists. 
 The root of the conflict lies in World War I, when the British made conflicting promises to both Arab Nationalists and Zionist Jews to enlist their help in defeating the crumbling Ottoman Empire. The Arab Nationalists, led by the Hashemite dynasty, wanted a unified Arab state that would have included the modern territories of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine/Israel, and Hejaz (West coast of modern day Saudi Arabia), while the Zionists wanted an independent Jewish state in the Palestine region.

 I am a Pakistani and thought I'd throw in some insight into how this guy's mind and how it was working. You can rest assured that this kind of practise is a rare occurrence in the country of almost 177 million people. 
 First and foremost 
 
 Yes this dude's mentally unstable. 
 
 No, Islam does not allow infanticide. 
 
 
 The reason why I mention Islam is because it is a uncontested majority religion in the area and a major part of the country's constitution. 
 As can be seen by the reports, people are not happy and talking about burying him alive or burning him. That's all hyperbole until someone as unstable starts thinking more into the idea.... <_< 
 So the fact of the matter is, Pakistani economy is in the slumps. A minority owns the majority of the country. Businesses are packing up and leaving. Shit's hit the fan. 
 Cost of living is similar to the US or UK, however, if you convert the average income, I would say it would be about 50,000 Rupees a month (roughly 500 USD). 
 Trouble is, that is for an educated university graduate, IF he/she finds a job. 
 Now the majority of the country is illiterate and do manual labour (which is looked down upon and paid considerably lesser) 
 So this guy 
 
 is most likely illiterate and does not know babies have alien heads 
 
 wanted a son who could help him make money (most women/daughters end up being housewives) 
 
 Any handicaps of the mind or body are basically a sure-fire way of being a crippling burden on any of these families both emotionally and financially. 
 
 Human rights and gender equality all sound all nice and sparkly until you have to fight to survive and figure out where your next meal is coming from. I pooped a little. I'm not saying he was poor poor but he saw a future where he would be (in case of a mentally challenged child). 
 
 
 He basically lost his shit and thought that he nipped a potential 'problem' in the bud. 
 Most people tend to generalize whole populations regardless of local issues/situations and label them as savages and such. 
 I think this person was just a rare product of society. The desperation and poverty in Pakistan make it a ripe environment for people to flip their shit.","Dude got rid of a 'financial leech' in his mind's eye due to crippling inflation and poverty.

 Yes, FGM is dangerous and painful in the way it is currently being practiced. However, the way many organizations are addressing the issue is in fact causing more issues in itself. The advent of initiatives to ""end the atrocity of FGM"" has correlated with a spike in dangerous forms of the practice. What many fail to realize is that FGM is a part of many foreign cultures, at least in Africa, in the way that circumcision is a rite in Jewish culture. Rather than attempting to eliminate a practice that is sacred to people, we should be lobbying for a compromise, such as creating laws that require a procedure where small, non-life threatening cuts are made in a sanitary medical environment.

But objectively speaking, annexing a neighboring territory is a significantly larger encroachment then anything the US or UK have done in a very long time. 
 As far as nationalism, the US and UK have fierce nationalism for their countries but not for anyone in particular. The only people the US and UK really idolize are football players. People's opinions on Obama and Cameron vary, but neither is popular. Putin has far more direct influence over the country, the people, and the government. Not too mention his rise to power. Can you imagine if a high ranking agent from the CIA/MI6 became leader of their country, pooled their power and led the country for 15 years? America being run directly by the CIA, with the ability for them to effectively bypass the political checks and balances of the American government would be an absolute nightmare scenario, and it's exactly what is happening in Russia. 
 Putin has generally soaring reported approvement rankings and also censors all forms of media to some degree, to the point that Russia is making their own fucking Wikipedia. His foreign policy is also almost entirely about being the antithesis of the West. Drumming up nationalism by constantly antagonizing the Western World in every way possible. Instead of admitting Russia's problems are often internal and addressing them, the government constantly projects it's problems on the Western World. 
 Yes the US has isolated Russia some, and that Cold War rivalry is still there but the American/UK public really doesn't hate Russians nearly as much as the other way around. We've made plenty of our own enemies and have our own messes to clean up, but when were upset about something in our country we get angry at our president and our fucking Congress/Parliament but don't generally blame our countries problems on Russia or any other country. 
 There are also far more naturalized Russians living in the US than there are Americans in Russia and the US is far more ethnically and ideologically diverse in general. Russia's entire system feeds into an aggressive, antagonistic nationalism. That combined with Putins influence, power and public idolization create a dangerous combination which is why European and American governments are getting worried about Russia's current actions and potential plans for the future. The US/UK system does not allow any one person to control the government long enough for the kind of plotting, scheming and shadiness that goes on in the Putin government.

worldnews,cpjej03,"What makes you think there is negative unemployment in the tech sector? 
 I work in tech and have heard the phrase 5-6 times in the last year either from recruiters or in others in the context of recruiting.  Just to be clear, this is the west coast.  Job markets can have some regional effects, but a lot of recruitment here is global(!), so that might not be relevant. 
 Regarding the article, firstly they are all just quotes from a source that has an axe to grind.  In the interests of a fair conversation I am avoiding calling him biased Yes he was a successful whistle-blower, so I'll listen to him just out of respect for that, but the article just sounds like him venting. 
 Let me comment directly on his statements to illustrate my view on the situation.  Full disclosure:  I'm an Indian tech worker, lived and worked on the west coast for the last couple of decades.  Some companies you must have heard of, some startups. 
 >most of these workers have only a bachelor's degree: How is this specialised talent? 
 This guy seems to have little experience in the industry.  Bachelor's degree means very little.  Demonstrable tech skills do.  The industry is in a position to absorb  any  functioning talent, and functioning talent has been a desperate need for the past couple of decades barring a short period after the dotcom crash. 
 >Americans are being displaced at record numbers. Foreigners are working full-time jobs in the US without paying income taxes and are not qualified 
 Straight up bullshit.  You pay income taxes regardless.  Illegals, prostitutes, drug-dealers all pay income taxes.  Nobody fucks with the taxman.  As to his quote from Infosys' Nandita Gurjar, I am having some trouble finding the original context.  It is  highly  unlikely that the statement was meant to mean what he seems to imply. 
 >""I have read statements from NASSCOM stating that if the cap is not increased and with the current visa restrictions, the Indian economy would suffer. Let me ask the committee, what about our economy? 
 What an utterly asinine statement.  Someone enroll this guy in a basic economics course.   India raises and trains these people and then they produce in America.  How does this hurt the American economy?  The level of entitlement here is staggering. 
 Basically the problem is this fine parsing of what ""specialized talent"" means.  It doesn't mean post docs.  Any functioning tech talent is specialized talent.  I have seen this carping for a couple of decades now, and when in the driver's seat,  down to the man , Americans will hire from wherever they can.  Thast is because recruiting is a nightmare and a massive drain on time and money from the smallest company to the largest. 
 Regarding their competence, as most Americans in this sector will say ""let the market sort it out"".  Is this guy really the person to tell Google, Microsoft, Amazon et al. how to  hire ?  That is a little out of his area of expertise.  He is famous as a whistle-blower not a successful tech entreprenuer. 
 Yes Infosys got caught doing dirty stuff.  Seriously, I don't care for what I have heard about their work culture either, but I'm not about to join an anti-Infosys lynch mob.  Every major company flies to the very edge of the law and beyond, and employs an army of lawyers.  ""Don't be playa-hatin'"". 
 As I said, I have heard this kind of bitching for a long time now.  Still, nobody has stopped hiring these people.

The suburban north of Seoul is within firing range of NK artillery positioned very close to the border in a specific area. You have to take into account that (a) North Korea does not possess a large amount of modern or well-maintained artillery, that (b) their ammunition tends to have lots of duds(50%), as evidenced by the leftovers of when they shelled an SK island a while ago. 
 Inflicting significant damage on Seoul would require them to amass all their capable artillery in a small area within enemy artillery range whilst focussing all their firepower onto a non-military target. Fireing artillery is very, very visible if you have the right equipment. The almost sad state of the NK air force would also grant SK/US forces instant airspace superiority. The combination of these factors will result in a very fast destruction of all NK artillery in the area.

 The boost phase program never demonstrated any kind of operational capability and was shuttered with the cancellation of ABL.  It would also be impractical, since we don't control the airspace over NK well enough to maintain a fictional jumbo jet within range of their launch site 24/7.

 A) most of the ""succesful"" tests to date have been unrealistically rigged  (e.g. NK isn't going to provide us with advanced warning, telemetry data, beacon the missile, or wait to launch until an aegis ship gets into proper position)

 i would start with whatever laws exist on the books in the place where you live.  be aware that laws on assisted suicide are many and varied, even if they don't explicitly mention it by name.  for example, in Canada, it falls under the rubric of no fewer than 12 sections of the criminal code and parts of the constitution (Charter of Rights and Freedoms).  after you've familiarized yourself with those, at least loosely, move onto what other jurisdictions are doing: Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Oregon and Washington State all have legalized assisted suicide in one form or another, and the British Columbia Supreme Court ruled in June that it should be available to Canadians, but that is being appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada - stay tuned for that decision in the next 18mos or so. 
 after that, you can dive into what NGOs/advocacy groups from both sides of the issue are saying.  among others, some of the more famous pro-assisted suicide campaigners are: [Farewell Foundation]( [Right to Die Society of Canada]( [Death with Dignity National Center](  then, on the other side of the issue are largely religious and disabled-persons advocates: [this]( is a long list of those groups. 
 if you're serious about getting involved, on either side, i suggest perhaps volunteering at a hospice (just to see what end-of-life health professionals think) or, barring that, find people who are already active in the community and have a chat with them. 
 it's a difficult topic and isn't one that i've entirely decided on which side i fall.  but this much is certain: the public debate will be happening more-and-more as the baby-boomers get closer to the end of their days.  they have had full control of their lives up to this point, and  won't be letting the issue go without having their say.  my feeling is that it's inevitable that most western countries will soon have laws in place that allow for people to choose the timing of their deaths some way other than 'traditional' suicide.",read about the laws on assisted suicide in your country before moving on to advocacy groups like Death with Dignity or the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition.

The  fact  is every newspaper in America knew about this and they  chose  not to tell you. As a matter of fact (though i cannot prove it) I believe they are complicit in the whole thing and are even participating in it on various levels. Did no one else think it was odd that the possibility of US news agencies bugging phones just never seemed to come up at all? As if it wasn't even a possibility? I am fairly certain they were (and may still be) just they never got caught. I remember being shocked at the fact that one of my editors casually told me (back in 2003), that I was the only person in the world that accessed the papers website via Safari. She also related various other sites that I was accessing as if it were some common knowledge. Scared the living shit out of me. 
American news agencies were also fully aware to within a 1 year window that the global economy was going to fail. They knew why and how, but it was up to the markets for when exactly. Basically they were just holding out so that friends and family could squeeze it for all it was worth before bailing out.

worldnews,c7on085,"Actually, it's incorrect. All members of those communities are subject to those laws, not just Aboriginals. The local police officers, social workers and health workers (those who are non-aboriginal) are also unable to purchase those items. They're totally restricted from sale. 
 As for dictating how welfare money is spent, that's not race specific either. Any person found to be incapable of limiting their purchase of alcohol, tobacco, other drugs, pornography or gambling services has the majority of their payment made to an 'essentials' card which can only be used to purchase items outside of those categories. Some of the payment is still made in cash so purchase of restricted items is still possible unless they live in a community where sale is banned. 
 So aside from being incorrect, someone from Arizona shouldn't be making wholesale judgements based on a few weeks of observations. One drive down the main street of Port Headland should be enough to convince people that these communities need to be dry.

They live off the land, dispense their own tribal justice (spearing is still common), and teach their culture to their children.

I read a [piece]( about him in the National Post a few days ago defending him and his policy against Islam. Fuck everything about that. 
The article basically says that Wilders is right because: 
> ""Islam demands submission in every aspect of human existence, both through the wording of the Koran itself and the Shariah law that has developed in its shadow.. The faith also supplies a justification for aggressive war; vilifies non-believers; and pronounces death upon its enemies. In short, Mr. Wilders argues, it has all the ingredients of what students of 20th century history would recognize as a fully formed totalitarian ideology."" 
 Isn't that true to some extent about Christianity and other religions too? It is not what the book says that is the religion. It is the believers that make the religion. If the Bible or the Torah are followed as literally as possible then their respective religions can easily be has hateful as Wilders says Islam is. However people have chosen to recognize that their book might be wrong, at least in part, and that as such they should not follow it word for word. I believe that 99% of Muslims around the world have reached this conclusion.

 In 2008, Human Rights Watch released a report reviewing Chávez's human rights record over his first decade in power.[288] The report praises Chávez's 1999 amendments to the constitution which significantly expanded human rights guarantees, as well as mentioning improvements in women's rights and indigenous rights, but noted a ""wide range of government policies that have undercut the human rights protections established"" by the revised constitution.[288] In particular, the report accused Chávez and his administration of engaging in discrimination on political grounds, eroding the independence of the judiciary, and of engaging in ""policies that have undercut journalists' freedom of expression, workers' freedom of association, and civil society's ability to promote human rights in Venezuela.""[289] The Venezuelan government retaliated for the report by expelling members of Human Rights Watch from the country.[290] Subsequently, over a hundred Latin American scholars signed a joint letter with the Council on Hemispheric Affairs criticizing the Human Rights Watch report for its alleged factual inaccuracy, exaggeration, lack of context, illogical arguments, and heavy reliance on opposition newspapers as sources, amongst other things.[291][292][293] The International Labor Organization of the United Nations expressed concern over voters being pressured to join the party.[213]

In 2010, Amnesty International criticized the Chávez administration for targeting critics following several politically motivated arrests.[294] Freedom House listed Venezuela as being ""partly free"" in its 2011 Freedom in the World annual report, noting a recent decline in civil liberties.[295] A 2010 Organization of American States report found concerns with freedom of expression, human rights abuses, authoritarianism, press freedom, threats to democracy,[296][297] as well as erosion of separation of powers, the economic infrastructure and ability of the president to appoint judges to federal courts.[296][297][298] OAS observers were denied access to Venezuela;[298] Chávez rejected the OAS report, pointing out that its authors did not even come to Venezuela. He said Venezuela should boycott the OAS, which he felt is dominated by the United States; a spokesperson said, ""We don't recognize the commission as an impartial institution"". He disclaimed any power to influence the judiciary.[299] A Venezuelan official said the report distorted and took statistics out of context, and said that ""human rights violations in Venezuela have decreased"".[300] Venezuela said it will not accept an IACHR/OAS visit as long as Santiago Cantón remains its Executive Secretary, unless the IACHR apologizes for what he[clarification needed] described as its support of the 2002 coup.[259][301] 
 Chávez, speaking at the 2003 World Social Forum in Porto Alegre
Venezuelan Judge Maria Afiuni was arrested in 2009 on charges of corruption, after she ordered the conditional release on bail of banker Eligio Cedeño, who had been held on charges of fraud and other crimes due to alleged illegal currency trading activities. Some human rights officials alleged the arrest was politically motivated; Cedeño ""had been in pretrial detention for nearly three years, despite a two-year limit prescribed by Venezuelan law"".[302] Cedeño later fled to the U.S. to avoid prosecution. Following Afiuni's arrest, several groups, including the United Nations, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Episcopal Conference of Venezuela, Human Rights Watch, the Law Society of England and Wales, the U.S. Department of State, and the European Union Parliament accused Chávez of ""creating a climate of fear"" among Venezuela's legal profession.[302][303][304][305][306][307][308][309] The European Parliament called it ""an attack on the independence of the judiciary by the President of a nation, who should be its first guarantor"".[310] A director of Human Rights Watch said, ""Once again the Chávez government has demonstrated its fundamental disregard for the principle of judicial independence.""[302]

Although the freedom of the press was mentioned by two key clauses in the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela, in 2008, Human Rights Watch criticized Chávez for engaging in ""often discriminatory policies that have undercut journalists' freedom of expression.""[289] Freedom House listed Venezuela's press as being ""Not Free"" in its 2011 Map of Press Freedom, noting that ""[t]he gradual erosion of press freedom in Venezuela continued in 2010.""[311] Reporters Without Borders criticized the Chávez administration for ""steadily silencing its critics"".[312] In the group's 2009 Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders noted that ""Venezuela is now among the region’s worst press freedom offenders.""[312]","Chavez influenced the judiciary, attacked the freedom of the press and tried to silence his critics."
worldnews,ckdyegt,"that cases are being VASTLY under reported. 
 It's actually pretty easy to see this based on the statistics that have been reported from the start of the outbreak.  At first I thought the numbers were oddly off, then they make a frightening kind of sense. 
 Originally MSF and WHO reported about 60% mortality based on head counts.  Currently the death toll is about 2290 with about twice that infected, or about 50%. 
 The historically reported death toll from this strain of the virus (Zaire Ebolavirus) is about 90%.  So why is this outbreak less deadly? 
 There are a couple of possibilities for this discrepancy.  One of those is that this is a mutated or new virus with different mortality rates.  Despite the ""experts"" on reddit saying significant mutation is unlikely, it's possible for the virus to change its behavior by mutation.  It gets more chances with each patient infected. 
 Another possibility is that some factor in the areas undergoing infection is different from the areas which have historically reported outbreaks, and this is somehow (oddly) decreasing mortality in this outbreak.  Something like a factor in the local diet that inhibits the infection or a partial resistance to the virus due to previous infection with another kind of virus with some common genes is possible (not likely). 
 The most likely reason (in my opinion) the numbers are off is incomplete data, IE the people compiling reports don't know about a significant portion of infections and deaths due to the virus.   The reported numbers could be meaningless to the true size of the epidemic.",Reported statistics from the outbreak don't match historical mortality rates from the virus.  IMHO the most likely reason for this is incomplete data.

A comparison: if someone offered a 30-year deal of 60$/barrel of oil for a pre-set amount, companies would jump at the opportunity---especially if the price is market-adjusted like your Bloomberg link suggests, because essentially that means Russia is covering the risk on the investment. Look at how Moscow is currently suffering from gas-price dependency, this deal exposes them much more.

The United Nations also refuses to pay for the water that Shufat Refugee Camp consumes and it amounts to millions of dollars a year in losses for the Jerusalem Municipality.

worldnews,c2nxjbw,"Well, you should take everything with a grain off salt. This massive fine is basically government PR stunt and/or party tactics. Right now we have a massively populistic, anti-market, nationalistic right-wing  government (now there's a cool mess for ya), with absolute majority in parliament. They can legislate anything and they do, with a worrying speed. The plant owners allegiance is more to the previous government party who were majorly spanked in the last round of elections. 
 The current government temporarily nationalized the plant right after the accident, put their own cronies in the saddle, and they seemed to bleeding the company dry. Probably because the owners could be financiers of the opposition in the next elections. 
 Of course this is speculation, but here are some facts : The plant and waste-estuary was a state-owned, state sanctioned enterprise (we are talking about communism here, though it was called socialism up to 1989) The new owners bought it in very shady ways in the mid 90'ies in the big privatization wave with a lot of government 'help' - that's where their allegiance comes from. They are called 'red barons' for a reason. 
 The expert consensus about the accident is that it was not negligence, or malicious use, not even greedy rule-bending: the company kept every regulation (which were not very clear for the first place)
 The major problem was bad geography: the estuary was simply built on the wrong place (by the state, in the 70's mind you) and because the company was ramping up production, and the estuary was begin to fill up more than it ever was. 
 Not the dam broke, but the ground slid under the extreme weight, and that broke up the dam, then the moving sludge completed the destruction. 
 After the incident, the blame game went for a full month between government agencies about who should have checked for this kind of problem, and the final answer was: nobody. There were no real checks against it, no competent agency to watch it. It just happened. 
 And instead of vigorous fact finding, and making sure it could never happen again by legislating actual laws or creating positions or agencies to this end, the government simply made a law which made it possible to nationalize a private company for undetermined time, and then went ahead and used it. 
 Now the huge fine: it wont help the affected in any way. It will be payed into the budget, and this government already has an extreme budget deficit. 
 Now don't get me wrong: the owners of this company had this coming. Polluting irresponsible companies should be fined with extreme fines to deter them to be so. But there you have it.

worldnews,c8o2fyl,"Spent the past 2 years studying nuclear power and weapons in culture at university and this what my dissertation is on, so I'd imagine I have what would constitute a knowledgable opinion on nuclear technology. 
I'm British. Britain currently stores 50% of the world's civilian plutonium. 112 tonnes of the stuff. With a half-life of hundreds of thousands of years. We import used nuclear fuel from countries all around the world. The idea is that someday we will be able to change it into useable energy. For the time being, we have no idea what to do with it. 112 tonnes of the most hazardous materials created by man is sitting just outside the Lake District (arguably the most beautiful area in England). 
 The point is that the dream of nuclear power has been seen as being 'just on the horizon' for generations. Honestly, look back to the early 1900's, people were already planning on using radioactive energy from radium to fuel cruise ships. People were going apeshit for the stuff. People wanted it on clocks, they wore it around their necks. They saw this stuff as the fuel of the future in the 1900s. But the idea of clean, almost unlimited, nuclear power never materialises. What does materialise, is the legacy of radioactive waste and human tragedies that arise from our chasing of this pipe dream. 
 We also have to bear in mind that nuclear power is also not 'carbon-neutral'. The process of turning uranium into a useable form and the actual mining of it is not carbon-free.
Thorium power plants, in my opinion? Keep dreaming. We haven't even got nuclear power fully sorted out yet.","nuclear and thorium power resulting in cheap, abundant and carbon-neutral energy, are pipe dreams.

 First, following 9/11, the Syrian government offered enthusiastic cooperation to the Bush administration, and eagerly tortured numerous al Qaeda suspects. (Including a completely innocent Canadian, Maher Arrar, which is how the use of Syria as a torture site came to light.) 
 However, Syria has long been on Israel's hit list. Read the ""Clean Break"" paper, a strategy paper written by several of the leading neocon advocates of the Iraq war for Israel to understand why.

worldnews,cjwfsbl,"The main reason this happens (not just in Britain but in other parts of Europe) is a problem of integration. 
 Skip to the dotted line to skip the blabla. 
 Immigrants and especially their descendants would like to be European but still maintain their identities - which is a totally natural thing to desire. 
 Although this has been somewhat less of an issue in the UK, being able to do this is not easy, from both sides (immigrants & descendants v.s ""natives""). It's easier if the immigrants are white, or christian, than if they're brown, or Muslim. 
 It's not solely a racism issue , although racism plays its part (reduced social mobility for immigrants, especially considering they probably started pretty low on the ladder to begin with). 
 It's also a cultural issue. For example, secular liberal people are more accepting of intermarriage or inter-dating, more accepting of homosexuality also, and in Western Europe most native people are now secular liberals, whereas most immigrants are not. This creates a conflict where ""their values are not compatible with ours"". Their values are closer to Western Europe in the 50s and 60s than they are to the 2010s. 
 
 Basically, different cultures who have trouble mixing and getting along, which pushes a lot of young immigrant men to try and find ""their own culture"" rather than really try to integrate. In France it really is a problem since - for myself, being half Arab, I'm reminded by ""native"" people of that fact all the time. Might as well embrace it eh? I don;t (I'm a secular liberal atheist) but it's easy to understand why those people would stick together. 
 They then kind of embrace an extremist caricature of their culture, rather than how most people in their original culture actually live. The reason is that the roots of their culture are absent. Islam is 1400 years old, and the cultures of Muslim countries are thousands of years older than that. If you try and be of a culture without the roots of that culture around you, you'll end up with a caricature, a mutant, a sham. Most Muslim immigrant parents are appalled at their kids becoming terrorists or embracing violence. It is not something they would do themselves, ever.","different cultures pushes people apart.

worldnews,c3vbxno,"First, we have heavily modified the crops that grow in fields.  Do you eat corn? Bananas?  Cabbage?  Lettuce? 
 None of those grow in the wild, in fact, none of those grew  at all  until humans selectively bred for them.  This process  is equal to  genetic modification.  There is no effective difference. 
 Now, as for why I want that? 
 Economy.  If we simply Earth's economy... 
 The Earth can grow enough food, naturally, for 100 people.  Lets say we have 56 people on our Earth, without GM food we will have to impose population caps or risk starvation.  On the other hand, if we use GM food we can probably feed between 120 and 150 people, probably with less effort. 
 If we remove the cost of actually creating the GM food (because with a community of 100 you probably wouldn't be able to support the infrastructure for it), the overall cost of growing the crops likely goes down as well.  Instead of having 6 people for 56 (~10%), we could probably have 3 people (~6%). 
 Those factors, along with the fact that these crops are better for the environment, mean that GM Crops are, in general, better for humanity. 
 Oh, right, better for the environment?   Easy.  Less crop failures mean more efficiency.  More nutrients per crop means less overall crops gown.  Even if each individual crop takes more effort to grow, the overall impact on the environment lessens. 
 Now, one important factor to remember is that cycling crops becomes even more important with GM Crops, not cycling crops can lead to the land being over burdened. 
 GM Crops are desirable, not because they're 'science-crops' or anything like that, but because we can feed more people for less cost.  Organic foods are not desirable because they're natural, there's  nothing  wrong them, but being natural doesn't make you better.

 Edit &","I, like many, will definitely hear you out.  I understand your worries about GM crops, and I agree.  However, people take a lot of precautions and there are a lot of hoops to jump through before you can release a GM crop to market -- GM Crops do have some distinct advantages (as outlined above). 
 Did you know that there is zero need for anyone on Earth to starve?  We could, right now, feed EVERYONE on Earth.  We grow enough food, totally.  Our issue is cost.  We destroy food because there's no money in shipping it cross-globe, and it's difficult to grow locally.

 Basically, it is not bad you, or any other boy for that matter, was circumcised, BUT if it is completely unnecessary in regards to health (which really do seems to be the case by the latest studies), then the circumcision is only cosmetic. And I do not think any kind of cosmetic surgery should be done to children, whether it is to genitals, face, birthmarks or whatever the hell you can think of. If a kid then want it done later in life, preferably as an adult so the pressure from family is less, that is fine. But I think it is kinda wrong to force circumcision on to a kid if you know it is only for cosmetic reasons. Of course if there is a medical reason, say too tight foreskin, or what have you, cut away, just as you would regarding to any other medical issue. It is not the circumcision itself that is ""bad"" it is doing it if it is know to be, well, unnecessary. 
 So, having been circumcised or have had your kids circumcised is not something I see as something evil, or even bad, I am quite frankly a bit ""meh"" ^((I mean why should I care what your dick is like, I seriously doubt it is going to be a part of my life in any way)^) even though I highly support banning circumcision. 
 But, if you now know that circumcision is not for any kind of health reason, but only cosmetic or religious reasons, I think it is unfair towards a child to make the decision for them, since the decision is permanent.","I support banning it for future kids, that does not mean all circumcision done in the history of circumcision is bad. Just that new knowledge and hygiene practice makes it obsolete, so we might as well stop parents from doing it towards their kids."

worldnews,cnu2y5m,"It's really annoying when internet experts and armchair generals start running their mouths, when in fact have no clue what they're talking about. You represent both those factions with startling skill. Besides the utter arrogance of it, it wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't the danger that the ignorant and misinformed might believe you. 
 First, you proclaim the exact opposite of what I presented, without addressing any of my points on the matter. You don't deal with the inconsistencies of the Hamas/Gaza health ministry source/list. Namely, the issues of  duplicates , and intent to conceal and lie (as [policy]( and practice with [precedent]( As for proof for alternate lists, ones that suggest a militant majority, is backed by [sheer statistics]( actual ongoing i[n depth studies]( and historical precedent. All this can't be pushed aside with ""sorry"". 
 In regards to strategy, it's often standard operating procedure for armchair generals to attack a strategy without offering any alternative or examination of repercussions. You don't seem to shy from the stereotype. Your topical ""analysis"" ignores the realities of the scenario entirely. Rocket fire paralyses the south economically, causes hundreds of thousands in property damage, disrupts Israeli life and threatens the lives of Israeli citizens, threatens the country's geopolitical and military honor, and puts a political strain on ruling parties. A country's first obligation is to that of its citizens. In understanding how states function and what their responsibilities are, there was little choice but to commit to war. So, I answer. What did Israel accomplish? 
 Clausewtiz is famous for writing, amongst other things, that ""War is a continuation of politiks by other means."" Strategy is not only the province of warfare, but also of geopolitics. A good strategy addresses both of those worlds. Politically, Protective Edge reenforces the political aims against Hamas: keeping the organisation physically, economically and politically isolated, undermining its people's faith in Hamas, showing the world and Israelis that the IDF is a force to be reckoned with after continued rocket fire and the kidnapping turned murder, and finally reestablishing deterrence. 
 On the military scale, the goals were to create cessation of rocket and mortar fire on the Israelis south (either through destruction of rockets and launchers, or by pressuring Hamas into a ceasefire), crippling of Hamas cross-border capabilities, and damage to the organisation. 
 The first political goal is achieved by destroying tunnels, smuggling and attack alike, and securing of blockade positions. The second deepened Hamas' incredible financial difficulty by destroying vast infrastructure and military investments. The third was achieved with the galvanisation of the Egyptian position, and the Arab world's indifference left Hamas feeling alone and desperate. Israel displayed its military prowess in Protective edge, diffusing tactics and strategies that were very similar to that of Hezbollah's in 2006 and showcasing the Iron Dome system, and giving Israelis a sense of accomplishment and justice. Palestinian emotions ran high and supported Hamas during the operation, but afterwards they were left with bitter tastes in their mouth, and grumbling and criticising became more vocal and socially accepted. Finally, the utter devastation caused on Hamas infrastructure and military leadership is sure to make them think twice about another escalation, at least for another year or two. 
 Militarily, Cessation of rockets was achieved through the destruction of rocket stockpiles and launchers, occupation of prime firing positions, and sheer pressure on the opponent. The second goal was achieved through the destruction of tunnels. The third, which is important to political strategic goals, was done through targeted strikes against leadership, destruction of weapon and ammunition stockpiles, death of operatives, and destruction of tunnels, bunkers, weapon factories and command centers. 
 Strategically speaking, the invasion was fine. The only problem was some of its execution, specifically the sacrifice of surprise and momentum in favor of diplomacy and international goodwill. These gambles did not pay off. Further, in a conclusion that Thucydides also came to in his history of the Peloponnesian war, there was no lasting political conclusion achieved. It was a return to a status quo, albeit one more favor to Israel strategically. Finally, as usual, Israel failed to take into account the propaganda and media aspect of the war. 
 In summation, your evaluation of strategy is amateurish, and not grounded in the reality of warfare. Israel's strategy was fine, some aspects of execution were faulty. 
 As usual to your peculiar breed of keyboard warrior, you make claims and statements that are flatly factually incorrect. 
 
 ""Hamas buys rockets"" - the vast majority of Hamas' rockets are locally produced. 
 
 ""even more Gaza reconstruction funds"" - Gaza has barely received any of the promised funds, and it was agreed that the PA would oversee reconstruction. Of course, this will only result in the widening of the rift between Hamas and the PA. 
 
 ""Significant number of civilians"" - whether 2000 or 1000, neither is a significant number of civilians in the context of war. 
 
 ""Also last time in gaza they used white phosphorus, which has no real use unless you are trying to kill indiscriminately"" - White Phosphorus is primarily to create smoke screens, an important tool for any battle field commander. Further, the total Palestinian deaths in 2012 were little more than 150, 2 thirds being combatants. This is not the result of attempts to indiscriminately kill. As you say, in a populated area. Such a low casualty count in such an area of operation nicely supports my point.",Fuck you and fuck your feels of how you want reality to be.

 Besides the point, the issues with the spent fuel were completely separate from the reactor issues.

With all of the cooling efforts focused on the damaged reactors, the water boiled off and uncovered the rods starting the fire.

We knew the exact location where we dropped our mooring (via ship GPS) the previous year, returned the next year to that exact location to pick it up only to have no response signal.  I originally hypothesized that the stronger thermocline ""blocked"" the acoustic signal (either from the pinger or from the release).  We returned during the winter (when there's a weaker thermocline) and with a stronger pinger, which was able to communicate with and activate the release.

worldnews,cos76rb,"Keep in mind what is stationed in japan with those P-8As. One command ship, One carrier, two Cruisers and nine Destroyers. 
 The command ship is kind of a write off, she only has close support armaments but still mounts Phalanx anti-missile defense systems. 
 The Carrier contains 90 aircraft, a crazy amount of sensors (Air, Surface, Subsurface) and 7 different anti-missile defense weapons. 
 The two cruisers are both missile cruisers, armed with cannons with a max effective range of 24 km and laundry list of missiles for anti air, surface, sub surface, anti missile and land targets ( Max ranges: AA=240km, Surface=185, Sub Surface=22km, Anti-Missile=2500km, Land: 2500km) total of 122 each. 
 Lastly the destroyer group armed with the same cannons as the cruisers and many of the same missiles. but where the Cruisers carry more cruise missiles for target destruction the destroyers are loaded with more sub surface munitions and anti air. Total of 90 missiles each. 
 That's a lot of fire power in such a small group. Hell that's more fire power than most nations have period. And with those ranges anything east of Lake Baikal and south of Neryungri in Russia and the western half of China could be targeted. With a conservative guess of 10% of the missiles being cruise missiles that gives the fleets around 159 cruise missiles, hell that's a bit high lets say 5% are cruise missiles. That would give about 74 1000 pound cruise missiles. 
 Each of these 1000 pound missiles has and effective casualty radius of around 200m and a lethal blast radius of around 30 meters (turning people into hamburger). In a perfect strike situation that would be 74 targets turned into 20m craters. Most strike targets would be shut down by this amount of damage. This isn't even going into the armaments of the 90 aircraft on the cruiser. 
 Taking from previous use of cruiser groups the initial attack would consist of Cruise missiles striking key locations in the intended invasion zone. Command and control, airfields and static AA defenses would be the first targets in that order. In this optimal first strike situation the C+C would be taken out in the first volley, slowing down scrambling fighters. The second strike would disable key airfields effectively grounding the opposing air force (Planes don't take off from fucked up airfields very well). The final wave of missiles would clear operating areas for the carriers aerial forces. Allowing them to strike targets of opportunity. After the missile strike the destroyers would move in to shell any coastal defenses in ensuing chaos brought about by a loss in C+C functions. 
 If this was truly a first strike situation the 3 other carrier groups that are normally within 68-120 hours of Carrier Strike Group Five would be a lot closer. 
 After this bombardment the opposing nation would have to scramble resources from other locations to bolster the defenses of the target area. In the examples of Russia and China they have a huge amount of land to cover and would have to either repair the near by airfields, erect combat airfields or conduct dangerous long range sorties. But once this becomes a land war the opposing nation would have an advantage. Russia has a huge focus on the older concept of war. Military thinking is still rooted in World War 2. Taking land or defending it inch my inch. And if the US got pulled in to this kind of battle it would be bloody and long. I still think the US would prevail because of the Air Support but it would be a dark bloody affair.",Cruiser Groups are assembled with these thoughts in mind.

 Have you ever stopped to think about why the scientific method is a valid way to be maximally certain of a natural fact?  Because, by you saying that someone else's viewpoint is just as valid as mine means you haven't really thought about the scientific method and its value. 
 >Christians will point to the Bible to validate their beliefs. Atheists will point to the lack of evidence of God to validate their beliefs. Neither method of validation is scientific. 
 I, at least, don't believe in the Christian god simply because someone hasn't shown demonstrable and reasonable evidence of his existence.  I imagine the majority of atheists feel the same, but I could be wrong.  This is a  reasonable  position, unlike the Christian side.

Objective truth can only be obtained through omniscience (a godly quality).  For example, you can't prove we aren't brains in a vat.

worldnews,chdiyqp,"Oh, don't get me wrong, I think the problem in Ukraine is really a big spy game between Russia and America (Russia is winning hard up to now, despite and economic costs that they will have to pay). Russia is demonstrating their intelligence and counterintelligence. 
 The US, by some accounts was taken off guard and didn't see any of this coming; it actually demonstrates a pretty significant hole in US intelligence. Americans should be asking more questions about why they didn't know what Russia (Russia, for fucks sake - the most dangerous non-American country!) is planning. 
 If they were, ""surprised"" by Russian decisions and had to scramble to put together plans to counter them, that should be considered treasonable incompetence on someone very high up's part. 
 Statements like Obama's contention that Russia was not a major geopolitical threat just demonstrated his lack of understanding of geopolitics. 
 Threats are measured by counting how many guns another country has, not by what our feelings are toward them at the time (someone soon is going to put together a conspiracy about Obama himself being a KGB agent, if Russia keeps slipping surprises like Crimea past us). 
 > If Russia can annex part of a country overnight without the USA knowing about it, Russia can launch a nuclear missile at Washington D.C. without the US finding out. 
 When the CIA and KGB are operating in the same country it means we are indirectly in conflict with Russia. What did they expect was going to happen? No leader can say this, because diplomacy and spying both require a fair bit of deception, but it's fairly obvious that that's exactly what's happening in Ukraine.

 Keto is faster no doubt and easier. It isnt some miracle diet though. Generally people on keto lose slightly more weight than people on non-keto diets. Fat also goes away faster, but again it is slight. 
 The main advantage like you said is because it is easy. Very easy. Eating carbs causes your blood sugar and insulin to spike causing hunger cravings. This is a huge reason you overweight. On keto you dont get these. Also fat is more filling and keeps you full longer. 
 The water weight is kinda true but only in the beginning. When you first start keto you lose a tremendous amount of water weight. However, after a short period of time 2-4 weeks it should all be gone. people on keto still tend to lose weight slightly faster than other diets after this period. 
 If you are doing keto right you should be getting a ton of fiber. I get more fiber than I ever have in my life. My bowel movements are great. A vitamin supplement is a good idea though. 
 The main advantage of keto is not faster weight loss, although it does have slightly faster weight loss. It is ease of use. 
 However, you missed the big advantage. Keto is popular with body builders and athletic people for a reason. Hugely popular. That is you can lose fat and gain muscle at the same time, and lose less muscle during a cut. In a normal diet your body will resort to reducing muscle before fat in a deficit. In keto your body will target the fat. So it is easy to put on muscle while cutting fat. Keto isnt the best diet for non-active people. 
 That being said it has disadvantages for really serious bodybuilders since carbs are important to building muscle and recovery. Keto bodybuilders arent like Arnold in the 80s or strongest man in the world competitions. They are muscular and lean. Kinda like Brad Pitt in Fight club or the guy in Momento. They have big muscles but not HUGE muscles, with little fat. Those crazy big people need carbs. There are Keto variations that involve carbs to get around the lack of carbs. The biggest source is carbs up where people on a 24-72 period go nuts on carbs creating an anabolic effect. 
 edit","Keto you lose weight slightly faster than other diets but in other diets you lose more muscle and less fat than you would in keto whereas in keto you lose more fat and less muscle compared to other diets. For weight loss any diet can work for fat loss Keto is probably the best diet.

Western regions of Russia have 100% AA coverage, and we are talking about echelon AA (that's when you combine cannons, short, medium, long, ballistic-missile capable AA and airplanes with all kinds of long-range radars that can see for thousands of miles, include satellites and first warning systems, etc.) - nothing we have ever faced. Russia has more advanced ballistic missiles and AA than we do, simply because that is the route they went - we developed strike capabilities, they developed anti-air and retaliation capabilities. There are also nuclear subs which they have lots of and strategic bombers. Oh and a few thousand short-range tactical nukes which will turn Eastern Europe into a radioactive cemetery and cannot be intercepted. 
 There is also the Dead Hand: a computer deep under Ural Mountains. Even if all Russian leadership is dead and command centers are destroyed, retaliation is guaranteed: Dead Hand will detect a nuclear attack against Russia and respond by nuking everything and everyone, but mostly NATO countries, without any human input.","You play Call of Duty too much.

 The fact you can't (for whatever reason) comprehend that, is neither here nor there, and certainly doesn't bear any relevance to the plain facts (The UN having recognised the state of Palestine completely belies your assertion above).

 Don't Palestinians have a right of self defence (against an ongoing medieval type siege by the Israeli military) too?

worldnews,cc6qgfw,"I think this is buried enough to avoid downvotes and be able to have a rational discussion. I'm Christian, specifically I was raised in the Disciples of Christ church. I really like your post because it emphasizes so many things I was taught in the church (very small, 30 members at the time and in SE Nebraska) growing up. I specifically remember a Sunday school lesson I was taught during junior high. 
 At the time, a lesbian couple had just attended one of our church services. Our entire congregation, with the exclusion of one older man, was very open and kind to them and invited them to stay for lunch after service. They came, prayed with us, and promised to be back in the future. At Sunday school the next week, our teacher was still fuming about the one old man who had said ""If they're lesbian, why do they think God cares about their problems?"" One of my classmates asked, ""Doesn't the Bible say being gay is wrong?"" This was her (paraphrased) response: 
 'Jesus prayed with prostitutes, thieves, cheaters, liars, and sinners of every shade and scale. If the literal incarnation of God on this Earth prayed with these people, who can say that the Lord doesn't love above all other emotions? We are ALL created in God's image, not just those of us who come to church each Sunday. If you only understand one thing from the Bible, I hope you see that it is a story about how dearly a Father loves his children. The Lord gave us minds to think, hearts to feel, and souls to pray for understanding (this is a common phrase in our congregation). Worry about your own walk with God. The only reason you should worry about another person's [walk] is to try and help them find a way to talk to the Lord. I don't know if being gay is right or wrong. Neither does Pastor Swenson or the Pope for that matter. You can only find the answer in your own heart through prayer.' 
 Sorry for how super long this is becoming but I have carried that message with me for over a decade now. We have all been given the ability to think rationally, feel empathy, and pray for understanding. If I want to understand the bio-physiological effects of steroids on myeloid precursor cells (my area of research when I was in graduate school), I could work it out rationally and ask my professors. If I want to understand the wishes and guidance of God, He has given me an avenue to pursue those answers through prayer. Each person needs to develop their own understanding of God's will for them through personal prayer with him. No one else can tell you what God wants you to do or think.","I like your post. Our understanding of God and his will should only be developed through a combination of rational thought, an inspection of the inherent good in all people, and INDIVIDUAL and PERSONAL prayer to Him.

 A virus is kind of like a cell except even smaller and not capable of independent replication.  A virus has to enter a host cell of some sort where it injects its DNA/RNA to essentially hijack the cell and turn it into a factory that produces more copies of the virus.  During this process the viral DNA/RNA can end up modified/mutated.  Any of these mutations could potentially allow the virus to spread more ways.  The more times the viral DNA/RNA is replicated the greater the chance will be that the virus mutates in a way that allows it to either become airborne or etc.  So as the epidemic spreads to more people the fear of it mutating increases. 
 Granted, that is a gross oversimplification of the processes involved but maybe that addresses your question somewhat.",version:  Each time the virus replicates there is a chance it mutates.  More people exposed = more chance for mutation = possible increase in the chance of it going airborne.

 We aren't going to reduce this conversation to Democrats vs Republicans when this is clearly a global problem. 
 The Banks aren't scared of Obama, they're scared of the uncertain economic climate (I agree).   The global economy is partly regulated and partly unfettered.    History has shown that a completely unfettered market gets easily corrupted and is prone to catastrophic bubbles and crashes.    It's happened time and time again, so let's not have a conversation that repeats a problem we've already experienced. 
 I also fully admit that badly regulated markets are prone to bubbles and failures and vice and corruption (which just happened). 
 We have to police this market.  This market has always had thieves, it's always had manipulators.    That's never going to change. 
 We can agree there are people out there who want to profit on the system.  We can agree that they will manipulate it if they have the chance to.    We can agree that the housing market was not rational, not sustainable yet it lasted long enough to bring the entire world to its knees. 
 Do you think it's so impossible to believe that the commodoties market is immune to what happened in the housing market?   Masses of people flood an avenue that shows growth for wealth and then are astonished when it proves to be unfeasible?   (Yes I agree that I might be wrong about manipulation, maybe it's really greedy people who are too lazy to investigate long-term issues) 
 Do you think it's impossible to believe that the commodoties market is immune to what happened in the credit default swaps market? 
 Why should commodities be any different?  It's operating under the same exact system that the swaps did.   Why didn't the system work then?  Why didn't it work GLOBALLY if the problem was Fannie Mae?  Because the problem wasn't Fannie Mae. 
 Everyone is using the market for their own gain.  The market, left unfettered, will spike and dip and spike and dip and the answer to those spike and dips are rules and laws.  That is the system's response to something unsustainable. 
 The brains of people who experienced the unfettered system said ""this isn't working"" and responded.  Their response was undermined by thieves who manipulated the new system. 
 You don't want the government to manipulate the system.  That's not going to stop thieves and millions of people with poor short-term interests from creating a new bubble  (manipulating the system, capitalizing on the system, creating a dutch tulip mania for lack of a faster way to get rich). 
 You think government intervention is unnatural.  You don't see that all of it is natural.    Unions are natural.  That's organizing to use your collective power to get more money.   Trying to bust up unions are natural, that's using your fiscal power to protect your own interest. 
 And on and on. 
 Yes, food rots. Yes, this bubble will burst.   We'll see what the roiling impact of that's going to be.  Already, the short-term impact is a lot of people who are reducing their spending everywhere else to pay for food, bank's uncertainty because no new jobs are being created and because people aren't spending more. 
 The uncertainty doesn't come from what's going to get regulated.  Why?  Because no one's regulating anything!  Nobody is worried about what the ineffectual bickering government is up to.   The uncertainty comes from the fact that market shenanigans blew up the world economy and no one has even the remotest plan for figuring out what happened and how to fix it.   Neither does anyone, the world over, have the political willpower to approach it. 
 I'm close friends with a person who works at Fitch.  He told his superiors that they had junk (before the bubble burst).  They wanted to fire him because their clients were the people they were grading.  Now he's in charge of his division. 
 But have we changed the system to say that the people who grade the quality of securities should not be paid by the people who have created those securities?  No?  Why?  Because you and I are sitting here arguing about Obama. 
 It's not Obama.   It's the markets.  The markets aren't functioning.  They might put us into a death spiral.  The natural response is to try and figure out a way to get our long-term interests to work in this system.  Our short term ""Get rich today!"" are going to blow up in our faces. 
 Again. 
 Edit:","I will concede it might not be manipulation.  It might be a Dutch tulip mania bubble.  But it's not sustainable, and the answer is not ""government shouldn't manipulate the market.""  The market is a human system and humans from every quarter are manipulating it.  Arbitrarily excluding the government isn't going to fix the problem.  The government is a straw-man that lets us avoid the hard answers that our system isn't acting in our best interests and no one is coming forward with a plan to make sure it doesn't blow up in our faces and drastically reverse our global quality of life for generations."

 I'm prepared for this to get buried, but I hope  someone  sees it before the thread dies, 'cause there's a lot of misdirected outrage and misinformation circulating around this event. 
 If this was a legal hunt (which it most likely was, because she hasn't been arrested yet), the lion pictured was bred in captivity, on a farm, specifically for the purpose of being hunted. 'Canned lion hunting'. This means two things: 
 1) By killing this lion, she is not creating a deficit in South Africa's overall population of lions, because this lion was bred privately, in captivity - it was not part of a herd in a reserve. 
 But, far more importantly: 
 2) Canned lion hunting is legal for  everyone  with a permit. There are plenty of South Africans who have lion hunted (relative to the total amount of people who have hunted lions in South Africa, not our overall population, obviously), and this is by no means the first foreigner to hunt a lion on our soil either. Hunting happens all the time in South Africa - I've seen plenty of Facebook albums of Kudu and the like which have been shot by South Africans I know, and yet there isn't nearly the same level of outrage as in reaction to Bachman's hunt. If you're going to take an issue with hunting for sport, you're going to need to take an issue with  all  hunting for sport.","Bachman isn't decimating my country's lion population, and outrage at the lion being hunted is completely arbitrary."

worldnews,ca3sbix,"You are right that ""tar sands"" was not coined by environmentalists as I originally purported. However, times and technology change. Oil sands has become the accepted nomenclature within the industry (biased of course) due to the hydrocarbon nature of the bitumen. 
 > There is a deep irony here. The oil patch whose professional communicators now insist that they are “oil sands,” and that no other term is acceptable, were motivated precisely by the faith that a hydrocarbon is a hydrocarbon—a faith that took 50 years of research and investment, and hundreds of millions of dollars, to ﬁnd even the ﬁrst hints of economic justification. It has taken another 20 to convince the world that the oil sands were commercially viable—a lot of “peak oil” nerds still haven’t gotten the memo—and that explains why the Alberta oil patch is so sensitive to marketing. 
 So while both are considered acceptable as of now, the split between terms causes a restrictive separation. The ""tar sands"" in thrown around by environmental groups to portray a dirty image on the sands. What needs to happen is a common adoption of ""oil sands"" as the terminology. The current division creates unneeded separation between sides and limits productive discussions. This is not beneficial to Alberta, or Canada as a nation. The one thing many seem to forget is economic prosperity provided by the oil industry extends country wide ([e.g. equalization payments]( So while I agree that the environment is crucial, it remains important to develop the oil sands in a environmentally friendly manner. This can be fostered by honest discussion between sides; this can begin in earnest when media fueling terminology is avoided.","Though you are correct, the viscosity of the petroleum leading to the terminology is from a time long past and things have changed."
worldnews,cchcmza,"It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom.""  - Bill Hicks 
 From the very beginning, marijuana (and other drug) prohibition was intended to create an excuse to control a segment of the population and protect certain industries.  Various paper industries were at risk of [losing millions of dollars]( so they funded massive yellow journalism campaigns and laced them with racism, even so far as a congressional testimony claiming that [marijuana made white women want to sleep with black men.](  Marijuana was immensely popular in jazz clubs, which often meant plenty of black people were smoking.  [Harry J. Anslinger]( was the slimeball who led this charge, he had a file called [Marijuana and Musicians]( and hoped to ""pull off a nationwide dragnet of jazz players."" [Cocaine]( was also popular among blacks at the time. 
 Very convenient way to enslave black people again.  Not many know that the abolition of slavery had a very explicit loophole.  The 13th Amendment to the US constitution states ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,  except as a punishment for crime  whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States,or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""  There are  more black people in prison 
 Let's fast forward a little.  During the US invasion/occupation of Vietnam, there was a massive anti-war movement in the US.  Marijuana was popular amongst the anti-war crowd and it would make a great excuse to break up activist groups.  Nixon signed the DEA into existence and used it to [target anti-war groups.](  Psychedelics, like LSD and psilocybin mushrooms, have a bad habit of turning people into pacifists, so those had to go too.  Tack on to that the fact that those drugs help break down psychological barriers, like nationalistic propaganda, and it's pretty obvious why the US would want those illegal. 
 This whole time the US is twisting arms around the world to pass similar drug laws.  Never mind the fact that prohibition never fucking works, or that maybe drug addicts should be treated as ill instead of as criminals, there is just too much money to be made tossing people into private prisons or outright [stealing your property]( in the name of preventing crime. 
 Then there's the infamous crack epidemic of the 80's.  The CIA had a pretty big hand in [creating the whole thing]( or at the very least was complicit.  Crack cocaine, which is pharmacologically identical to powder cocaine,  carries astoundingly higher sentences as compared to powder cocaine, the big difference being who uses which.  Powder cocaine is a white person drug, crack is a black person drug.  Once again, we're looking at millions of black people being sent to prison for an arbitrary reason. 
 This shit pisses me off more than I can express.  There is only person who should have any say about what goes into my own body.  Obviously I'm talking about the drug czar, so it's a damn good thing that [these people know what the fuck they're talking about.]( 
 Drug prohibition is about control and profit, that's it.  Private corporations not only run prisons for profit, but they contract out with prisons for [cheap labor.](  It's slavery, literal fucking slavery, and it's going on today.  A holocaust in slow motion, prisoners are [treated like animals]( and the prison population is still growing.  It's one of the biggest industries in the US and there are no signs of that going away. 
 The whole thing is supported by propaganda (lies) and enforced at the barrel of a gun.  We have storm troopers busting into people's houses, [killing their pets and terrorizing their children]( under the guise of 'protecting people.'  There are over [40,000 SWAT team raids per year]( and DHS grants are giving police more and more money to buy military equipment to use against civilians.  They're [raiding farmers]( and [killing veterans,]( there is absolutely no justification for this shit. 
 
 Enough of the evidence, here's what I think is happening.  The US is rapidly becoming an Orwellian police state.  Whether intentional or not, the war on drugs has taken us in this direction.  We have universal surveillance of ordinary people and [domestic police are becoming an occupation force.](  There is growing civil unrest in this country, jobs are disappearing and poverty is on the rise.  The ultra wealthy, who control our government, own private firms who work for the NSA, effectively [own the global financial system]( and are actively trying to censor the net, are preparing for a class war of epic proportions. 
 Legal systems are in place to arrest anyone for any reason, there are plans to set up [""Internment and Resettlement""]( camps across the country, terminator-esque robots are [being developed]( right under our noses, and we're sitting here getting pissy about Miley fucking Cyrus.

This unit had studies done because they were trying to better understand what was going on as the suppression chamber failed in an unusual way. The drywell failure was not due to melting fuel directly, but due to lack of decay heat removal. Unit 2 had cooling for over 70 hours so on the 15th the fuel WAS uncovered, but the reality is if they were to just keep injecting water, without decay heat removal, you would eventually have had an overpressure. 
 All three containment vessels had exceeded their design pressure limits by up to double for some period of time. Unit 2's containment failure simply means that it no longer met its leak-tight criteria. It was no longer a fully functioning containment per technical specifications, however the containment didnt blow a hole in the side or anything like that. It is more akin to a seal or o-ring blowing out allowing for a leak path. The inner containment is not exposed and neither is the vessel. You cant look into it or see into it. It is still sealed in all other places. Additionally, the containment still held in an extremely large amount of radioactive material. IF the containment had fully failed and ruptured or been exposed, the amount of radioactive material release could have been as much as 10 times greater. The NRC evaluated this scenario and was coming up with over a 100 mile evacuation zone after they saw unit 1 have its hydrogen explosion. The fact that it was just a containment leak means the vast majority of radioactive material was still contained, just not as well as it was previously (when it was still leak-tight). 
 As for the fuel, it is believed that not all of the fuel in unit 2 melted, and there are varying theories on where the melted part ended up. It may not have breached the vessel in any large amount, but this is uncertain and I think the endoscoping they are doing will provide good information regarding this.",containment did lose leak-tight seal. was not completely destroyed. large amount of radiation still held in. could have been much worse.

In the event that enough of a party's represntatives win the election, that party forms government the leader of the party becomes the prime minister and the ministers represent their respective departments. 
 The critical part of this is that each representative is elected individually and  the party  holds government  not  the prime minister.

Hell, you haven't even shown that it is more common for a British actor to play a villain over a hero.

worldnews,c410hx4,"Necessary and sufficient conditions have to do with how definitions work logically. But let's start with something more basic. 
 Logic involves a lot of ""if/then"" statements. 
 ""If Spot is a dog, then he is an animal."" 
 ""If I can see, then there is light."" 
 Stuff like that. 
 It's important to remember that most If/then statements  can't be reversed. 
 ""If Spot is an animal, then he is a dog."" -- you don't know this! Data on Star Trek had a cat named Spot! And that cat was also an animal! 
 ""If there is light, then I can see."" -- you don't know this! I might be blind! Then I couldn't see even with the lights on! 
 A flipped statement like this is called the  converse . If a statement is true, its converse is not necessarily true. 
 There is a way to flip a statement like this, called a  contrapositive  that is true: 
 ""If Spot isn't an animal, then he isn't a dog."" -- That's a good example. That's the right way to flip an if/then statement and have it still be true. 
 Okay, so there are certain kind of statements that, when you flip them, their converse is still true. These are generally called  ""if and only if""  statements. 
 ""I can see if and only if there is light."" 
 Logically this means the same as ""There is light if and only if I can see."" 
 What this statement does is rule out any of the other reasons I might be able to see or not see (like my relative blindness, or whether I have echolocation, or whatever), and it also makes it totally clear that turning the lights on will let me see. 
 ""If and only if"" statement exists if and only if there are  necessary  and  sufficient  conditions. 
 So, that's why necessary and sufficient conditions are important. They determine whether you can flip a statement -- whether a statement's converse is true. 
 Now, what are necessary and sufficient conditions? This is a little tricky, but here's my take. 
 The sufficient condition is the ""if/then"" -- 
 In ""If Spot is a dog, then he is an animal,"" being a dog is a sufficient condition to being an animal. You can be certain of the latter statement. 
 The necessary condition is the ""only if"" -- 
 In ""If Spot is a dog, then he is an animal,"" there is no necessary condition. There is no reason why, if he is an animal, he must necessarily be a dog. 
 Because there is no ""only if,"" you can't flip the statement. The converse, ""If spot is an animal, then he is a dog."" is not true. 
 So, a sufficient condition says  ""This is true if something else is true.""  -- we are establishing certainty about whether we are dealing with truth. 
 A necessary condition says  ""This is true only if something else is true.""  -- we are establishing what sort of other truths are within the truth we are talking about. 
 Let's change it up a bit to illustrate, just because defining an animal isn't very intuitive. 
 ""Spot is a mammal if he is a dog."" 
 This is true. Being a dog is a sufficient condition to being an mammal. 
 ""Spot is a mammal only if he reproduces by fertilizing eggs."" 
 This is also true. Fertilizing eggs is a necessary condition to being a mammal (let's dimiss the issue of spaying and neutering for the moment). 
 You'll note that you actually get a better idea of the things that make up being a mammal from necessary conditions than from sufficient conditions. The necessary conditions are things like ""making milk,"" ""having fur,"" etc. 
 But talking about the necessary conditions to being a mammal makes it a lot less certain you are talking about mammals. It's a necessary condition to be able to play baseball to play on the New York Yankees! But if we're talking about anybody who can play baseball, we aren't necessarily talk about somebody on the New York Yankees. 
 You are more certain you are talking about mammals when you are using a sufficient condition like ""being a dog."" But you are learning a lot less about what makes up a mammal or what a mammal is like. Dogs are identified by distinct qualities that aren't true about mammals in general at all. Mammals don't all bark or chase cars or get fooled and excited by imitation bacon, thinking it is real bacon and freaking out about it (well, most of them do, but not all of them). 
 So, in a very rough way it's sort of ""necessary = descriptive"" versus ""sufficient = certain."" Sort of. 
 Anyway, swap the ""if"" and the ""only if"" the logical statements, and it isn't true anyway: 
 ""Spot is a mammal only if he is a dog."" 
 That's clearly false, because of Data's cat in Star Trek the Next Generation. 
 ""Spot is a mammal if he reproduces by fertilizing eggs."" 
 That's also clearly false, because he could be a reptile or something like that. 
 So... 
 Most dictionary definitions present necessary conditions -- things that help with ""only if"" statements. 
 ""A thing is an aardvark only if it is an animal with a long snout that eats ants."" 
 ""A thing is a pair of pants only if it is a garment worn by people that has a closed inseam and two legs."" 
 Stuff like that. 
 However, it's important to remember that you can't flip these statements. The converse of them is not true. The dictionary definition is not a sufficient condition for them. 
 ""A thing is an aardvark if it is an animal with a long snout that eats ants."" -- Not true, could be an anteater. 
 ""A thing is a pair of pants if it is a garment worn by people that has a closed inseam and two legs."" -- Not true, could be pantyhose. 
 The big reason why dictionaries focus on necessary conditions rather than sufficient conditions is their function,  looking up words. 
 A dictionary definition says ""Okay, you have a word, let me tell you what it means."" 
 It does not tell you ""Okay, you have a thing, let me tell you what word to use for it."" 
 A dictionary is a lot worse at the latter than the former. 
 You can think of something not having a sufficient condition as ""Dwight Schrute-ing"" it. The character in the office loves to point out when somebody has specified a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition. 
 When you're making a logical definition, it is easy to make sufficient conditions that are true, and it's easy to make necessary conditions that are true. But it's hard to do both at the same time (at least without just repeating yourself) because you have to get super, super narrow on something to do it. 
 Ideally, the best way to understand the definition of something is to have the narrowest possible sufficient condititions, and the most comprehensive possible necessary conditions. 
 So, let's go back to fascism. 
 What the dictionary is saying is: 
 ""Fascists are right-wing, authoritarian and nationalistic."" 
 This statement is logically equivalent to: 
 ""Something is facist only if it is right-wing, authoritarian and nationalistic."" 
 That's certainly true. These are necessary conditions for fascism. But... 
 ""Something is fascist if it is right-wing, authoritarian and nationalistic."" 
 does not follow from the same statement - you can have monarchies or conservative-majority parliamentary democracies, or any number of other forms of government that share those qualities. 
 But a dictionary definition isn't really interest in providing sufficient conditions. It might provide enough necessary conditions that together those conditions become sufficient, but that's pretty rare. Usually they err on the side of being comprehensible rather than on the side of being logically thorough. And sufficient conditions are kind of incomprehensible for a lot of people -- or at least they feel like they don't provide a lot of useful information. 
 For example, ""Something is fascist if it is Hitler."" 
 That's certainly true. If something is literally Hitler, it is by definition fascist. Being Hitler is a sufficient condition to being fascist (unless we assume Hitler can change, which we generally don't). 
 But ""Something is fascist only if it is Hitler."" 
 Is definitely not true. There is Mousselini and Franco and other dudes like that. 
 You would not see a definition of fascism that says ""Hitler"" in a dictionary. Because dictionaries aren't intereste in offering sufficient conditions. 
 One of the reasons fascism comes up so frequently in Internet arguments is that there are plenty of necessary conditions for something to be fascism, but there aren't a lot of sufficient conditions for it to be fascism -- fascism was something professed by historical fascists, and mostly we just rely on comparing it to prior fascists for our sufficient conditions. 
 But because everybody wants to broaden the definition of fascism to include more and more things, we become looser and looser on the sufficient conditions and focus more and more on the necessary ones. Which means in the end we have very little definition at all and it float a lot and we make a lot of spurious and undeserved comparisons.","Sufficient condition = ""This if that."" 
 Necessary condition = ""This only if that."" 
 Necessary and sufficient = ""This if and only if that."" 
 Conditions have to be both necessary and sufficient if you want the converse to be true. 
 Does that make sense?"
worldnews,ci5cdgr,"Well written comment with some good insight on the US. 
 Fact is, there are plenty of answers to these questions if you(not you directly) actually look and listen, the better together campaign continue to ignore them however. They are also literally scaremongering with many things stated.(The Scotland can't use the pound is probably the most known) 
 They have also blatantly lied and been caught out, the most recent being when they and then the media began to publish false numbers on what it will cost Scotland as a country to go indie(The man behind the numbers even had to admit he was wrong). Which shows their incompetence and lack of research really. 
 It's just as easy for them to keep saying ""Wow, you keep saying we're scaremongering"" as it is for Yes voters to claim that they are. Now many Better Together/No campaigners answer questions with what's essentially ""Doesn't matter because you'll just say we're scaremongering"".. It's pretty petty shit. 
 From what i've seen people claiming they are scaremongering have reasons behind saying so at least. 
 Add to this one of the biggest reasons i'm voting yes personally is the Better Together campaign keep telling me why Scotland will be worse(despite many reasons being factually untrue) instead of telling me why the UK(factually) will be Better Together from Scotlands standpoint. Everything leads back to how it benefits England, that's why their campaign is constant slander and even false information.",Both sides have people who use a common answer to shrug of questions.

worldnews,ckfdsbj,"Ye, I think people are just getting a bit worked up because the system isn't the same as theirs. We all think our system is best! But thinking about it, I think the result would likely be the same in my jurisdiction. I.e. Murder requires intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, and the intent must be either direct or an objective virtual certainty. 
 Even with a jury, I don't think simply firing through a door has a 'virtual certainty' of causing death. From the evidence, we can't even show Pistorious was 100% certain of there even being someone in the bathroom. 
 The only major difference is that for us, as indirect intent is allowed, murder doesn't require a specified target. (R v Moloney). 
 Our system might be a little quicker, as the judge can simply give an alternative sentencing of manslaughter without the need for it to be charged separately. Really though, the only alternative sentence available here would be 'illegal act manslaughter', which is pretty much the same as 'culpable homicide'. 
 Then again, we also don't allow this level of media coverage of trials, and sentences are handed down all at once, meaning the trial isn't 'celebritised'. However, some people complain that we don't have enough transparency in our justice system, so I don't know...","People are moaning about the injustice, but I reckon my system would, although perhaps a little quicker, result in a very similar conviction."

Honestly, I find the whole religion reprehensible, and I congratulate moderate muslims for finding a way to conveniently ignore the numerous unpleasant parts of their religion that their more barbaric brethren seem more intent on observing. 
 For this reason I have a distaste for all of them. They all agree the same perverse religion is true, some of them just have a little more self control when it comes to the wife beating and murder. 
 >Can you not see how your opinion of a whole religion is absolutely no different to the opinions of a select few radical morons? 
 The problem is that it is not just ""a few radical morons"" who believe in strict observance of the hand chopping apostate murdering strict observance of Islam that some Muslims in the west conveniently ignore, [it is actually the majority of the muslim world]( 
 I don't think every single muslim is a terrorist, and that isn't the reason I don't like the idea of Islam- although it's ability to justify acts of terrorism in it's believers certainly doesn't help it's case. I don't like it because I've read the Hadiths and the Quran and I found them both disturbing and unacceptable as an ethical, spiritual, or practical guides to life. Look to the middle east to see what an incredible failure it has been for all but a few hundred years nearly a millenia ago during the Islamic renaissance. 
 >Islam is not incompatible with English law. Many many Muslims happily follow their religion while at the same time obeying the law of the land. 
 Actually it is, and people living peacefully under English law will have to ignore certain parts of their religious law to do so. The murder of apostates for example is something that is taken very seriously in the Arab world, but for obvious reasons that law is often ignored in western countries to avoid trial for murder (although some still do it anyways). 
 >What about those that are born Muslim, enjoy living in Britain and abide by the laws of the land? That must really confuse the fuck out of you. 
 Let them stay if they are behaving. I don't have to like them or their religion, but there's no law saying I have to if they are behaving. I think we should just be deporting the vocally anti-British muslim population that is pushing to make us live by their rules. Ya know, the ones who aren't choosing to ignore the more unsavory parts of their religion.

worldnews,cjkcqtd,"Ecuador may well believe strongly in the plight of the Palestinians but the thing that  enables  it to choose one side over the other is that it doesn't align with the US. 
 For people who don't care what a piddly country in South America thinks, I would suggest you reconsider. It signals something more important. 
 The US has worked hard and spent hard to stop Israel being a strategic and diplomatic weakness in the Middle East. That work can and may unravel quickly. 
 The US projects influence across most of the world. China, Brazil and Russia are notable exceptions. India is not quite in and not quite out because the US funds Pakistan. I know its fashionable to mock the EU but it is starting to wield influence more cohesively also. 
 The US does, however, control the Middle East. Israel aside, its allies are Egypt, Saudi, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and, theoretically, Iraq. The democratic legitimacy of the first five [Arab countries] is weak. They either rule autocratically, or rule autocratically as an ethnic minority and over an ethnic majority.  In other words, they are unstable . At the moment the US is wooing Iran - arguably the most stable country in the Middle East - in the knowledge that at some point reform right across the Middle East will have to happen, and with it a loss of US influence and an explosion of Sunni radicalism as blowback for years of repression. ISIS is a taste of this. 
 Israel is a useful wedge for regional power brokers to use to prise influence away from the US. I.e. China, Russia, Brazil and (in theory, India) as well as Iran can all encourage countries under their influence to pick a side. In other words, these countries can cost the US dearly their support of Israel. 
 Now, at the moment India and Russia both have good relations with Israel, and China increasingly so. A tenuous thread that unites them is that each is fighting a 'muslim' enemy [see note below]. But these are asymmetric relationships - Israel  needs  India and China especially because they are large trade partners. There are benefits from Israel to these countries, mainly in intelligence and technology transfer. But the long term value is debatable, especially given Iran's rise. 
 At the moment, Israel prevails - it can keep all sides on board, even as the US squares up to Russia and China and fights to get India on board. I would argue that at some point this delicate balancing act will move out of Israel's control. As the US loses influence, an inevitability given the economic rise of China alone, the chance that Israel becomes more of a pawn rises.","this is a harbinger of a much more fundamental changing of political alliances in the Middle East. Israel is unlikely to enjoy  more  support than it currently gets in the near-mid term.

worldnews,cfv5dr5,"If you think I'm connecting ice cream sales to crime in central park, you've missed my point entirely. 
 The reason why I brought that up was because it's  ridiculous  that ice cream sales would affect murder rates. However, it's also true that there's a correlation between the two. The point was to demonstrate that correlation and causation are not linked. 
 In the example, the correlation is probably to do with the time of year. Ice cream sales obviously go up in the summer, as does park usage, and with more people in the park, the number of murders that happen in it also increases. The point is that even though there's a correlation between the two statistics, it exists because of external factors and not because the two are related. 
 Going back to the issue at hand, the same concept applies. The JSF program and the Keystone pipeline are concurrent economical endeavours, but that in and of itself does not prove that they are directly linked in a ""give and take"" political deal.

 The German gov't doesn't give a SHIT about actual physical gold. They care about the value of it, to use as collateral. The word of the US is just as good.   
 Oh noes, evil ""fiat money"". What the fuck do you think ""money"" is then? Is there a car/ house/ service to correspond to every dollar in circulation in your book? That just shows that you fundamentally misunderstand what money IS, and what it ISN'T. Here's for all the simple conspiracy people: MONEY IS A PROMISE OF FUTURE PRODUCTIVITY, NOT A MEASURE OF TOTAL WEALTH. This follows neatly from the very concept of lending, inflation and deflation. There was never a time in history when money represented assets rather than the shared belief in a better economic future.   
 GOLD HAS NO VALUE IN AND OF ITSELF. Gold is relatively abundant (in comparison to e.g. rare earths, which are hard to find and desperately needed industrially), which sets its ""natural"" value to be quite low. The availability of gold is constantly shifting, as new mines are discovered, and as old mines become profitable/ unprofitable through the gold price. Hence (because of influx), gold is not a ""constant"" value, and its ""natural"" price much depends on current supply (like grain), so it is a very bad idea to base your state's currency on the value of it. Gold is also a shit investment, since it does not produce anything, and since there is no ""natural"" reason for it to appreciate in price (since as that happens supply is increased). So why is gold still traded? Simple, because it fulfils a different role in the markets: Gold is a measure of ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, which happened PURELY by popular opinion btw- if you believe that both bonds and equities may tank, you get gold, PRECISELY because it has no great industry utility (is somewhat decoupled of industrial growth). This works because everybody does it, and thus you MAY use gold to ""park"" investments while riding out some volatility storm. Utility of gold in a long-term portfolio, barring civil war? Zero.   
 
 To conclude, this whole conspiracy-theory reasoning of 1. ""Money is not real money if not based on an asset"", 2. ""Dey took our gold and sold it!"" is not only historically and economically WRONG, it is harmful for society as a whole. 
If you don't understand economy, why not drink a nice tall glass of shut the fuck up.","Everything about the previous post is harmful, simple-minded bullshit.

 Communism is not something you get overnight it is something to be strife for. Now, I don't pretent to know in which kind of government it would work, but government or administration is necessary in any society unless you reckon somalia is a model to be copied. I am not interested in the debating sizes of governments, though one thing I have noticed that a key factor in any egalitarian society is education. 
 All the previous attempts of installing socialism, departed from a populous with very little education, leaving the people at the mercy of their governors, effectively replacing any socialism/communism with state capitalism or excessive state control if you will. 
 In contemporary most egalitarian societies, like in Scandinavia, this equality stems from a significantly more educated population, and the government is made to serve its people and not the other way around. Strong unions, social programs,  cheap education has been a very present characteristic in such societies. Note that I called them more egalitarian rarther than socialist. 
 Meanwhile in the remainder of the (capitalist) world we extreme inequality with 1 billion people going hungry, politicians in the hand of the highest bidder and extreme wealth concentration in the hand of few, with numerous environmental crisis left unattended due to economic concerns .  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that such a system is not sustainable as time goes by.

 Also, look at this picture from the link below.  It is when nearly all of Asia paid tribute to China and are official paintings depicting them.  A envoy of Baekje(Kudara) is third from the RIGHT.  Japan(Wo) is fifth from the RIGHT. 
 As you can tell, Japanese (Wo) did not even wear shoes and the type of clothing and attire does not match their own past depiction of themselves in the present. 
 Look at the Baekje envoy.  His robes, shoes, hair, and overall appearance looks like a modern depiction of ancient Japanese from A Japanese perspective.  Doesn't that make you doubt your previous claim?  Perhaps the Beakje people colonized Japan and their original inhabitants that looked like the Tang dynasty paintings?  Or at least heavily influenced their appearance and customs? 
 The capital of Japan in 6th & 7th century was moved to Kudara Palace (meaning ""Baekje Palace"", and was a replica and named after of that building in Baekje) in what is now Kōryō, Nara.  The Soga clan of Korean origin was the most powerful clan in Japan at that time.  This is according to written history books, Nihon Shoki, and also here (under ""Connection with Buddhism & Korea"" section of the article): 
 The Baekje(Kudara) royalty shared bloodlines with Goguryeo(Kuri) and Gaya(Mimana)...so why not with the Yamato/Wa? 
 Also, why would the Emperor lie to his people that he has Korean blood flowing through him.  It's well documented and an undisputed fact. 
 Interesting thing is that still, to this day, the Japanese still use the word ""Kudara nai"" which translates to ""not of Kudara(Baekje)"" and is used to describe something worthless.

 Japan didn't sign up to the IWC to save the whales. It was basically a whaler's union, designed to ensure they didn't kill so many whales that the industry would collapse. Then, in the 70s and 80s, a bunch of non-whaling countries decided to join, and a bunch of former whalers (like the US) decided they wanted to get all judgemental, and demand that other countries also needed to see the light on how bad whaling was. By 1986, the IWC moratorium came into effect. 
 In 1991, whaling should have restarted, but the IWC ""justified"" the continued moratorium on the basis that the formulas for safe catch quotas still needed to be worked out. By 1994, it was becoming clear that there was no scientific justification for the IWC's moratorium. 
 Japan can just object, and tell the IWC to go fuck itself, and has threatened to do so, but under US law the US can sanction them for it, chucking them out of Alaskan fisheries (greatly reducing their non-whale catch).","the IWC shouldn't be stopping Japan from whaling, and can't stop Japan from whaling, but the US President is, through the threat of sanctions. But no-one wants to mention it, because poor countries want IWC related bribes (from both Japan and rich anti-whaling countries), non-US anti-whaling countries want the credit, the US doesn't want to look like a bully, and Japan wants to wheedle out a few ""scientific"" catches."
worldnews,c2wpzyu,"I've heard of a few studies which supposedly indicate that Piracy's negative effects of free distribution are made up for by the increased exposure of ones product paired with some of the pirates purchasing the products they really like. 
 I can definitely speak anecdotally to that end in my own behavior, especially with how high game and music prices have gotten. I'm not going to risk spending $50 on a new title if they do not provide a solid demo, which many do not these days, only to find that I hate the game. The same goes for music. I've purchased so many albums because of a catchy tune or two, only to find that I really dislike the rest of their tracks. Notch and his handling of minecraft should be the standard for how developers approach piracy. He didn't bother with any intrusive DRM, didn't freak out when he learned about minecrafts popularity on piratebay, and priced his project reasonably. His sales exploded and he's extremely successful now. 
 With music the issue is more complicated because of the prevalence of streaming websites. I've been using grooveshark almost exclusively for my listening as of late, so I haven't purchased (or pirated) much music at all. Still, if there's a band I really like, I'll go see them perform every chance I get, which from what I understand is the best way to support them financially. From what I've read, bands associated with major record labels get little to no revenue off of their album sales, it all goes to the labels. I don't mind fucking over major record labels, but I do want to support the artists. I think the industry as a whole has to move away from the labels and embrace the free exchange on the internet. There are other ways of generating revenue, and if the artists are getting the majority of the cut then even if revenues go down, the artist benefits. 
 So","I think pirating serves as a way for new developers and artists to get broad appeal. It serves as a demo opportunity for prospective buyers, and can make fans out of individuals who wouldn't have purchased the material anyway. Still, musicians in particular are getting boned over, but that's more of an issue with the labels than the pirates."

worldnews,cp8rxd5,"1) One would hope our canadian government is a bit better than the police state the US is turning into. 
 2) Making claims about Canadian judicial precedence from a US system with an entirely different history of precedence is not logical.  The US Supreme court has heard and judged cases, and from that long history of cases the US has arrived at whatever general legal opinion of their right to search and seize at the border. 
 Canada is an entirely different legal system, and simply claiming charter vs bill of rights = charter loses, does not make US judgements applicable in any way 
 3) Even if we were to claim that the US Supreme court case (cotterman) is at all relevant, the premise of the US case was that the items were taken and not returned for a long period of time - search and seizure.  Cotterman's objection was based on the US government's actions in transporting the electronics far away from border, which he claimed made it no longer a border search and therefore the evidence should be inadmissible.  Based on US precedent cases, the Supreme court pointed that border searches need not be physically near a border.  Cotterman also claimed that a 2 day period without his electronics was unreasonable - also denied the US supreme. 
 The Canadian in this case is not at all the same.  Perhaps it might be in the government's right to take his phone for an extended period of time and search it using whatever means is available to them - I haven't looked up the cases to check, because it doesn't matter. 
 This case, on the other hand, doesn't have anything to do with that.  They are charging him with obstruction for not giving up his own passwords.  It's a completely different level of invasion of privacy and completely untested.","the Cotterman case you pointed has no relevance both for its location (a different country and a different judicial system), and because its particulars do not at all match this case."
worldnews,cc3j81h,"Alright, this is gonna be an essay, so I hope someone reads it. Preferrably people with the same view as this guy. People need to do more research before blindly judging policy issues. 
 1: Climate change issue - I agree with the fact that climate change should be tackled, but the carbon tax is largely ineffective in doing so - putting a price on carbon simply increases the tax required to be paid by businesses and consumers, and does not realistically decrease carbon consumption. Think about it this way - have you turned off your lights more often, or been more stingy with your electricity since the imposition of the carbon tax? I highly doubt it. HOWEVER, I don't believe the carbon tax should be scrapped now as there isn't much point. It's a tax that's there, and mostly everyone has gotten over it, so may as well leave it there as a source of revenue (and if it really DOES end up having some effect, well, then, that's a bonus.) 
 2: Marriage equality issue - I also agree that gays should be given the right to 'gay marriage', however, it is not a very large priority issue. At the moment, gay couples and de factos in general have 99.9% of the legal rights that married couples have, so any 'substantive' equality issues are nonexistent. Secondly, it is BOUND to happen soon. I give it another one or two years, and it's definitely going through. No point in voting in our GOVERNMENT for such a small non-governance issue. 
 3: Thinks womens are second class citizens - this is so hugely blown out of proportion through media coverage and over-zealous feminists grasping at straws that anyone who really understands anything that's going on in the Australian political system, (or even truly considered the 'evidence' behind this allegation) should completely disregard this 'issue'. 
 4: Disaster regarding international relations: I in fact totally agree with this. This is my one biggest problem with Abbot. He is an extremely poor speaker for a politician, and I really wonder how he managed to get into such a high political position with such poor public speaking skills. However, remember the PERSON isn't important. We have a prime minister, not a president, and you should be voting for the PARTY and its policies, not for the person. 
 5: Wants us to have shit internet - I don't think that the majority of people complaining about not having the NBN even remotely understand what the NBN IS. Australia has an incredibly low population density, and the implementation of an NBN is a waste of infrastructure and taxpayers' money. Not to mention the fact that people don't seem to realize that the date of completion is 2021. You don't vote for a government for a policy which is going to take effect 10 years later. Secondly, people don't seem to realize that we CAN get fast internet, and Telstra (and I don't know, maybe others), already offer Internet above speeds of 100mbps (which is definitely fast enough). By 2021, even without the NBN, you will definitely have the option to get internet of NBN speed from private operators (unless you live on a farm or something). Sure, it might be what, 20$ a month more expensive? But so what, it's either that or 2k of your tax money going towards NBN installation. People don't seem to realize that the NBN isn't free for the government to implement. Getting our economy up and running is going to do a hell of a lot more good, and in turn private companies will be able to construct infrastructure superior to the NBN instead of simply relying on it due to the government funding of it. 
 6: Shit education - Gonski funds schools, and cuts down on university funding to do so. Let me tell you something, the people who fail at school fail not because our schools aren't properly funded, it's because they have no motivation to complete school and no ambition to get out. Throwing more money into school systems isn't gonna solve this problem, and it's cutting down on UNIVERSITY funding - note: where people end up if they TRULY have any ambition to be educated. the Gonski program is ridiculous and stupid, and scrapping it is great.","People need to research these popular 'one liners' that are being used to critique the Liberals, and think harder about what effect they truly have before having a cry about them."

People get up in arms at the government(s) in Ireland about these things because it looks like they're deliberately legislating new ridiculous laws (there was a similar case with blasphemy a few years ago). Really what's happening is that the government has to legislate on rulings made by courts and there has to be somewhat of a position that the state takes. Because the courts made a ruling in 2009 that a torrent site should be blocked by a certain Irish ISP the government has to legislate on that decision. So unless the state pretty much makes the decision to challenge or change the constitution this has to happen. In my email to the Minister I asked him to look into this and to hold off on signing the legislation until the public can offer him some sort of mandate as to whether they want to challenge the law or not.

worldnews,c08f8ce,"Considering the amount of time the average member of Congress actually spends performing Congressional duties, I doubt you'd just happen to have all of one party (but not the other!) there at one time.  Conceding that point, though, the rest of your scenario is interesting. 
 The USA PATRIOT Act was passed in Congress with a vote of 357 for, 66 against.  The Senate logged 1 nay.  Which party would you consider the opposition party in that case? 
 Anyone opposing the Act would have a very real fear of having their character assassinated by the media (or, next election season, their opponent), destroying their political futures. 
 Also consider that the media controls the information given to the people,  not  Congress.  Which means the fact that there are fewer people in government to ""organize around"" would be a moot point.  Especially when considering that it's more effective for the media just to report government press releases verbatim.

worldnews,cbw8kdz,"There's another problem though, which I don't really agree with but seems to be factoring in: 
 If you we're a dictator putting down a rebellion whose major hopes rested on foreign intervention, proving the threat of intervention to be a bluff would be an enormous strategic win, morale wise. At face value (for arguments sake) Obama has no real desire to enter the fray - his electorate doesn't want it, it's expensive and uncertain and no matter what he does it'll probably end up killing more people than died in the attack. 
 Obamas position creates an interesting calculus for Assad. If he can use chemical weapons, but leave enough ambiguity to give Obama an out politically, could he essentially achieve this strategic win? If it works and they can muddy the blame internationally enough to void the threat of intervention the rebellion suffers enormously - and the rebels will have to honor the threat of a potential chemical weapons attack at any moment and at little cost to their opponent. 
 The counter is simple but painful: Obama drew a line and determined that it has likely been crossed, he then imposes the penalty. 
 The problem with that is that if he does impose the penalty (to whatever extent) it's unclear what will stop Assad from simply going all out. I presume a staggered level of interventions is on the cards but in the end if Assad suffers enough to create a risk that he'll lose, he has no motivation to hold back.","I have no idea the whole thing looks like a clusterfuck to me, glad I'm not the one making decisions"
worldnews,cdmj5up,"Not quite. I'm doing a  bunch  of reading between the lines here, but it appears that RBS targeted small businesses that had loans with them that had assets (inventory, property) that could be quickly sold for close to retail prices. 
 Remember, when most of us sign a loan with a bank, if you read the contract carefully, you will find that the terms are very advantageous to the bank. 
 For example, when you sign a 30 year mortgage, the bank usually puts in a clause that the bank can demand payment in full at any time.  Banks rarely exercise this clause, and it's put in to protect the bank in case you start doing something shady or something that causes the bank to fear that you're doing something with the property that would cause it to suddenly become worth a lot less (i.e using it to dump toxic chemicals). 
 When this happens, you will get a letter from the bank stating that they are exercising this clause and give you 30 days to come up with the full amount or they're going to foreclose.  You're very unlikely to be able to get another loan from some other bank in 30 days - banks don't work that quickly - but especially at that point in time because ALL of the banks were under stress and virtually no one was handing out loans. 
 So it appears the a  recovery unit  within RBS intentionally started shopping their customers (that were otherwise in good standing) that had inventory or other assets that could be quickly sold for good prices, but would go for a pittance in a foreclosure.  This was done in order to quickly improve the banks bottom line, but it's kind of like eating your own tail because you're hungry. 
 They then either exercised a clause as previously mentioned, or started inventing charges and fees that they knew that the business couldn't meet, in order to force the business into foreclosure. 
 The bottom line is don't be near a drowning man unless you're a REALLY strong swimmer - you'll get pulled under with him.

 First, it's arguable that his government doesn't ""work"".

Additionally you usually don't calibrate whole body dosimeters for external alpha sources (which have more ionizing charge capability than beta/gamma radiation). So what happens, when you put an alpha emitter directly on the detector, it's going to assume that it is seeing beta/gamma, its going to assume its a whole body penetrating dose, and its going to multiply what it sees tremendously. That's why the use of a standard electronic dosimeter is not appropriate in this case. 
 Alpha is not an issue as long as it doesn't have a pathway to getting inside your body, because alphas cannot penetrate the skin. If you were really getting 33.3mSv/year whole body dose equivalent from those wristbands, those things would be setting off radiation detectors all over the place (last summer someone had a medical procedure that involved radiation tracers and set off the Chicago CTA radiation detectors in the subway, so these things do exist).",wrong type of meter for what the guy is trying to measure

worldnews,c3dmb7w,"Once again you have to consider the context. Essentially there wasn't enough momentum in 1989 to pass a wholly new constitution, so Hungary continued to operate under the soviet-induced constitution of 1949, with several amendments added between 1989 and 2010 to patch over some of the rougher portions of the 1949 constitution (such as lack of free elections, which came in 1990). 
 In 2010, the new government led by  Fidesz  initiated a drafting process for a new constitution. A parliamentary committee for drafting the constitution was set up, with all five parliamentary parties represented. The consultation involved questionnaires being mailed out to all citizens for their opinions; and though only some 11% were returned,  provisions were then included or excluded based on consensus among respondents. The following April, the constitution was approved on a 262-44 vote, with  Fidesz  and the  KDNP  (Christian Democratic People's Party) in favor and  Jobbik  opposed. The  MSZP  and  LMP  (Politics Can Be Different; Hungary's green party), citing the ruling party's unwillingness to compromise on issues and their inability to change the outcome, boycotted both the drafting process and the vote. On April 25, President Pál Schmitt signed the document into law, and it entered into force on the first day of 2012. 
 In an effort to push the public debt below 50% of gross domestic product (from above 80% at the time of adoption), the powers of the Constitutional Court on budget and tax matters are restricted until debt falls below 50%. The President is allowed to dissolve Parliament if a budget is not approved, and only companies with transparent activities and ownership structures are allowed to bid for government contracts. The powers of the head of the National Bank are also limited, and the modification of tax and pension laws requires a two-thirds majority. The life of a fetus is protected from the moment of conception, and although the article of the constitution is seen as opening the possibility for a future ban or restrictions on abortion, existing laws were unaffected. Same-sex couples may legally register their partnerships but marriage is defined as being between one man and one woman. A ban on discrimination does not mention age or sexual orientation, while the constitution allows life imprisonment for violent crimes without the possibility of parole. Judges' mandatory retirement age is lowered from 70 to the general retirement age–62 at the time of adoption, set to rise to 65 by 2022. The provision also covers prosecutors, while the Chief Prosecutor and the head of the Curia are exempt. The country's name is changed from ""Hungarian Republic"" to ""Hungary"", and although the country remains a republic, the preamble contains references to the Holy Crown of St. Stephen (which has been traditionally been the 'logo' so to speak of Hungary, and is included on the country's Coat of Arms), as well as to God, Christianity, the fatherland and traditional family values. Certain issue areas, such as family policy, the pension system and taxation, formerly under the purview of the government in office, can be altered only through ""Cardinal Acts"" passed by a two-thirds majority and not subject to constitutional review.",Hungarians elected a center-right reformist party and so they got a center-right constitution.

Rent control in many major cities is intended to make housing more accessible for lower income tenants. However, most economists believe it can reduce the quantity and quality of housing. Landlords often circumvent the rent control by extracting bribes in the form of key money.
So the end result is middle class people in rent controlled housing get subsidized rent while the poor continue to get shafted because no new housing is built due to cost>profit because prices are fixed.

worldnews,c68wttv,"Yes, this happens, and a LOT. 
 As you might imagine from my comment about my personal dating life I'm not of that opinion. The main problem is those communities are different, very different, and it's not as easy to ""live together"" in practice as it is in theory. 
 One of the main things that factor into this is the ""staged"" immigration. For the most part, communities largely immigrated together at a set point in history (you can read more about that [here]( if this interests you. 
 For example, in 1929-1939 most immigrants to Israel were from Germany (mostly escaping from the Nazi regime). Those people were mostly educated and urbanized, so instead of settling in small villages, they settled (and mostly established, with the wealth they were able to sneak out) urban areas. 
 The jews that lived in Israel at the time were mostly farmers and ""land workers"" due to the fact that early Israel was basically and inhabitable swamp land. The jews that were already there accused the new wave of jews for ""taking advantage of things we worked hard for"", and were outcast in the ""general public"". 
 At around the 60s-70s the Jews from Arab countries started to come in masses, those were mostly simple villagers, not educated wealthy urbaners of the previous wave. Now, the Germanic jews, who by now finally got into the general public viewed the new wave as inferior and as one of those who would ""live on what we have built and accomplished"". And the cycle continues to this day. 
 I personally got to experience that cycle coming from the soviet union in the early 90s, our wave (like every wave before us) were seen as outcasts. I got the shortest end of the stick as we moved to a mostly Mizrachi area, which were the previous wave at that point, considered as part of the ""general public"" and who's turn it was to hate the new wave, which I was a part of. 
 Today, while the ""new wave hate"" continues to some degree, there's a much deeper divide between Ashkenazi and Mizrachi jews, mostly for cultural reasons. 
 A good case of this was our first ""Big Brother"", the country was pretty much divided over two characters there: An Ashkenazi chick and Mizrachi guy. The guy loved playing practical jokes and teasing people, including said woman. Eventually it escalated to almost a hate relationship between them, and the arguments of the public were simple: The Ashkenazi crowd saw the guy as  barbaric  and misogynistic, while the Mizrachi crowd saw the chick as  uptight  and closed to harmless fun.","an old sketch shows it great, it basically shows how each new wave of immigration was looked down at by the previous one.

 Then reversing on campaign promises, doing the same things the previous government was doing, being very anti-homosexual, focusing on an almost USSR or NAZI Germany style of stereotypical citizen which is hilariously at odds with most French. There's been pro- and anti-religious marches, Hollande manages to piss off both groups. 
 The best part though is that when the average French citizen feels threatened by their government they usually react unlike most countries. So way back when the (non-Hollande) government tried to pass employee reforms vastly reducing rights, people tried burning down parliament with everyone inside. Truckies, cabbies, and people have blockaded streets, major roads, and fuel stations.

How do you reduce the unemployment rate? By A: creating more jobs (increasing number of labor hours needed) or B: spreading the same number of labor hours needed across a larger base of people. Let's say a company needs six 12 month workers to do a job. If the government says no worker can work 12 months, but instead only 10 months, you need 1/6 more of a labor force to complete the same job. Therefore, you must hire one more person, although the job could be completed without him  if everyone was working a normal work year  (vacation time skewed to illustrate the point).

 In the case of the disease discussed in the article, yes you can get medication that will help your eye. But new drugs and new indication face heavy bureaucracy. 
 Here's Lucentis' [approval guidance]( for the specific indication. The whole debacle is not an overnight affair, as the article seems to indicate. Nearly 2 years ago, the Department of Health asked NICE to [look into the usage of Avastin for the specific conditon]( I'm throwing in names because that's how bureaucracy works: 
 >Although NICE does not normally appraise drugs outside of their licensed indications it 
can happen at request of the Department of Health.  For example, the Department of 
Health has previously asked NICE to look at off-label immunosuppressive drugs for renal 
transplantation in children and adolescents. 
 So to get off-label it requires the Department of Health to be involved. As you probably read from the top response(s), doctors are quite confident in the usage of Avastin for the treatment of the disease in question. Even though it may sound like anecdotal experience, it is often through said anecdotal experience that you discover off-label uses (also see: anything pediatric related). In this case its usage must have been widespread enough for the Department of Health to notice. 
 Anyways, NICE's response was that it [seems feasible to add Avastin for this indication]( but needs more studies to be done. 
 Afterwards there isn't much news. I speculate that is in part because there is not enough studies (as stated in the article, the company who licenses Avastin in the UK has no interest in making these studies which can be expensive). However, because Novartis has went as far as they have with the legal matters means they wanna set the tone or market shares have gone south due to cost-effectiveness of the off-label useage of Avastin.","Yes, only Lucentis is approved, but it  seems  that the government wants to add Avastin, but lacks the clincal/economical data to reimburse it for that indication."

worldnews,ce46ez3,"this wikipedia article gives a bit of insight. 
 A bit of background as relayed to me by my Grandma:  The St. Louis Polish community wanted a Polish church, the Archdiocese, didn't care about them, and would not build it, so they raised their own funds, purchased the land, build the church and all it's facilities.    Thus the church that was erected was legally the property of St. Stanislaus Corporation and controlled by it's board of directors.   At that time the board was in good grace with the Archdiocese and their bylaws gave  their appointed pastor control with council from the board, but the legal rights were retained by the board. 
 In the 1980s they re-wrote their bylaws, taking control away from their Pastor, at which point the Archdiocese intervened and pointed out that canon law dictates they should cede the church to the archdiocese, which they were not super stoked about. 
 I get a little hazy on the history from here, and this entire story is hearsay anyway. 
 They wanted a contract with the Archdiocese that dictated how the property would be controlled should they cede it to the Archdiocese, and the Archdiocese wanted complete unfettered control.   Supposedly the land is very valuable, given it's location, as a STL native, I am skeptical regarding it's worth, but I've seen figures valuing it in the millions.   The board wanted guarantees their church would not be sold for profit, Archdiocese refused to sign a contract stating such, the board refused to cede the property. 
 All this time, the faithful were still attending Mass, and life was going on as normal, for the most part. 
 Then Burke arrived, and went on the offensive.  He removed the priests, and anything portable that he considered Archdiocese property, including the parish records. Also said they could no longer have communion there, and interdicted the board.   When the Board hired another priest from outside the Archdiocese, he excommunicated everyone on the board, also that Priest got excommunicated too if I recall. 
 The entire time this is going on, he was fighting with them legally, at no small cost to everyone involved, trying to insist that the changes they made to the bylaws that took power from the pastor were illegal.    Judges have repeatedly supported the board.",Parish board had legal ownership since they bought and built the church.   Archdiocese wanted it.   Board feared closure of church and resisted.

worldnews,cj7s4ue,"With nuclear weapons, the reason why Russia and the US have so many weapons compared to everybody else, is really a question of first strike vs. second strike. 
 A second strike is a deterrence. It's saying ""you can destroy me, but I'll make you suffer an unimaginable cost to do so."" So it's what we usually think about in nuclear holocaust: nuclear bombs landing on cities and killing millions upon millions of people. You don't actually need that many nuclear weapons to do the job. 
 The difference between France, UK and China and Russia and the US is that the US spent the early part of the cold war building a  first strike  ability. Basically, the Russian conventional threat (i.e., soldiers and tanks) in Europe was perceived to be so great that American military leaders felt the only way to prevent a Soviet invasion of western Europe was with the threat of nuclear weapons. I.e., if the Soviet Union invades Europe, America would nuke the Soviet Union. But... this would leave America open to a Soviet second-strike retaliation. 
 America wanted enough nukes that it could destroy all of  Russia's  nukes in the first salvo. So instead of civilian centres, a first strike primarily targets military installations, especially military installations housing nuclear weapons. Of course, the Russians understood this. There's a few ways to protect your own nuclear weapons from a first strike, and the easiest way to do that is to build a lot of nuclear weapons! And so the arms race between Russia and America was on. 
 If it ever came to it, most nuclear weapons would be deployed to blow up the other side's weapons before they had a chance to be used. Because when you absolutely, positively need to blow something up, and you don't have a second chance to do it, you blow it up with a nuclear bomb.","The reason why America and Russia have so many nukes is because the other also has a lot of nukes, and most of the nuclear weapons are aimed at each other."

The bank has 90%, Jo has 10%, but will end up paying the bank back say, 10%+10% interest for a total of 11%. So now there is 101% money in the system, 1% is debt. 
 If we extrapolate this over say 100 occurrences, we end up with 270% income, of which 100% is real currency and 170% is debt. 
 This simplifies the problem greatly, but it is infact what ends up happening over time. So a solution? Print more money? Well what is money worth then... Well, it is an extrapolation of what the people under the society will output, so every dollar printed will inevitably decrease the value of a dollar, which also drives the debt system forward.",Debt system feeds debt by resulting in more money owed then what actually exists.

worldnews,c12qg5h,"It's the most recent incarnation of an persistent dilemma: how should liberal societies deal with relatively liberal autocrats that rule ultraconservative societies? Often, in these societies the autocratic rulers are actually (relatively) liberalizing forces that keep demagogic conservatives in check. However, the only way they can do this is with very autocratic means. For example, Turkey is probably only as secular as it is today because the (secular) military establishment has a history of regularly deposing any popularly-elected ruler that goes too far in injecting Islam into the state, with force if necessary. (They have all the guns, so typically the threat of force is all they need.)  There's a similar pattern here in Saudi Arabia or Jordan, where the monarchy - basically whichever family managed to conquer all the land/ally with the colonizers back in the 20's and 30's - is actually much more liberal than their subjects, and in many cases educated in the West. But in order to impose these values on their countries they need to violate a bunch of liberal values, such as free speech, freedom of religion, presumption of innocence, and popular sovereignty. 
 Generally, Western governments have adopted the attitude of ""better a liberal autocracy than a illiberal democracy,"" which is why we're friends with the (authoritarian) governments of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait but enemies with the (democratic) governments of Iran and Syria. The operating theory seems to be that sooner or later the societies will also liberalize, the rulers will loosen their grip in response, and Saudi Arabia will look something like the U.K. with a lot of sand. Go too far with this theory, though, and you end up with a situation something like in Iran where the U.S. supported a violent dictator for years because he seemed better than the alternative.","Is a liberal autocracy better than an illiberal democracy?

 On the other hand, humans are like macroscopic-scale tardigrades (the little guys that can survive exposure to vacuum) - we can survive almost anywhere and eat almost anything.

worldnews,ccfo6vl,"This is key.  Couple of points: 
 For every dollar spent on pharma R&D, $6 is returned to the economy. 
 I am ""very close"" to a company that gained approval for a drug within the last 3 years that took over 15 years of research, development and clinical trials to bring to market.  There were billions spent on a ""bet"" that they had something efficacious. 
 There are a ton of ""bets"" that don't make it.  They still cost money, but they never make it to market.  My brother is a post-doc Chemist that makes a bunch of money at a pharma company.  The odds are that he will never create anything that the company can sell.  There are thousands of others like him.  How would you feel after dropping 12 years of your life living hand to mouth and incurring $200,000 in student loan debt so some ignorant social media dickbag could tell you that you were just a money grubbing corporate bastard?  I know my brother is in it to help people more than anything.  He also needs to pay off his student loans and make a living.  Think about the effect that incentivizing people against going into drug discovery will affect the human condition.  The 'evil corporation' has to pay its 'evil minions' otherwise innovation stops. 
 While the eventual  manufacturing cost of a pill is small, the costs to get it to that point are huge.  Think about it, if you had to make 100,000 cookies every day that were exactly the same (same amount of sugar, same number of chocolate chips in exactly the same locations, same amount of vanilla extract) how would you do it?  We want safe and efficacious drugs that meet every aspect that they have been tested for, there is no room for variance between doses.  Oh by the way, the burden of proving that you are doing all those things is on you and we will pay surprise visits, make surprise changes to the regs and fine you heavily if even one chocolate chip is out of place. 
 Finally, if the company doesn't make a profit, it will be unable to invest in future research or clinical studies to prove that it has a drug that can treat an illness.  The company will fold or be bought out and the world will move on, possibly without the innovation that could have helped the human condition improve. 
 I hear a lot of hate against the pharma companies, yet they are in the business of helping people get well.  It doesn't make sense to me to hate them and want to destroy them by making their business unprofitable.  Of course they want to make a profit, but so do doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists and anyone else in the healthcare field.  Think about the risk/investment each of these fields makes in order to find success and you will see why the rewards are the way they are. 
 There are a number of programs that pharma companies have to try to get affordable drugs to patients.  I think there are better ways to help patients than to make counterfeit versions of drugs.  Many countries use a formulary pricing stucture, some countries could subsidize the cost of drugs in association with a formulary.  Outright theft and the creation of something that isn't really the drug the patient needs is really just irresponsible and (profits and all the other stuff aside) puts people in a great deal of danger.","People deserve life-saving medicine, advances and innovation won't happen at a good rate without a profit motive, there is a better way to handle this than the way India currently is."

worldnews,c9pskrj,"While I can understand your sentiments, I think you misunderstood the concept of Death Penalty. Death penalty is not a solution to all heinous crime, it is a way to put harsher penalty to crimes and is ,more importantly, a representation of the justice system you live in. 
 Several points to consider: 
 
 There will never be a 100% to accurately locate criminals. While the justice system is fairly efficient, there will always be a small percentage of cases that is wrongly accused. Death Penalty on the wrongly accused would just mean murdering innocent people. 
 
 The fallacy with Death Penalty. You might think that death penalty is a way to put murders away for good. However, if you even kill 1 innocent people, then everyone who impose on the system will become murders, thus everyone should be executed. You can see that logically death penalty would not be a good rationale by moral standards 
 
 Death Penalty not only has a more severe impact on the criminal, but also the victim as well. Take for example child rapists. He raped a child and he will try to get away with it. If the conviction leads to life at prison, then the criminal might take a chance and let the victim live because it is less severe. If the conviction is death penalty, then there is a substantial increase in likelihood that they will kill their victims. Why? This is because the law takes away the mercy that the criminal is available to give. It is either the child dies or he dies. It will be safer to kill the child, bury it in hopes that no one will find out.","Death penalty does not provide a solution to more serve crimes, it is more about the justice system in place."

worldnews,c94uixl,"I love how conspiracy theorists are always trying to come up with ways to say ""Kim is not the leader, he's just a puppet."" 
 What evidence do you have of this?  What citation do you have where the military leaders are the ones calling the shots? What intel reports from the West are saying this? NONE. Fucking NONE. 
 Let me explain something logical here: If you're in a state where the population believes you are a deity---the reality of the military leadership not believing this lie---is irrelevant because the perception of where the power lies is the reality of power. 
 If a general says ""Hey General Zack, it's me General Bob, I'm really not liking the things Kim Jong Un has been saying lately, we should force him to say something else..."" General Zack can report you and eliminate his competition. 
 Thus a conspiracy theory revolving around ""Kim is not truly in control,"" is utter bullshit, because no cabal of conspirators can trust each other with such treasonous ideas.","Logically Kim is in control, the idea that he is not in control, lacks evidence and doesn't make any logical sense in a totalitarian state where Kim is considered a deity."
worldnews,c560go9,"We're not anti-science or zealots. On the contrary, we're probably more pro-science than the average pro-circ person (especially given the connection between circ and religion). Our arguments are based on legitimate scientific criticisms of the evidence base (see below). 
 Our main problem is that it is a violation of a child's human rights to circumcise him (or her for FGM) when he is too young to consent. This is not a scientific question (at least not yet, if Sam Harris has his way). It's a question of values and we value the right of every human being to a whole and intact body over the ""right"" of parents to force their religious or aesthetic preferences onto a child's body, permanently. 
 We're not arguing against medically necessary circumcision (though many cases where circ is supposedly indicated, there are viable alternatives, including removing only part of the foreskin, non-surgical options, frenuloplasty--circumcision may just be done because the doctor does not know about these alternatives, because they're not taught in med school, or because they're lazy, as it's probably a lot simpler and faster to do full circ than to do more intricate plastic surgery that they're probably not even qualified to perform). 
 We're just arguing against circumcision of children, especially infants, when they clearly cannot consent and there is no pressing medical need. We argue against the science because we have legitimate concerns with the science and because many people who were circumcised or grew up in a culture that told them circ was good, better, clean, beautiful, are deaf to human rights arguments. 
 The HIV studies were done in Kenya and Uganda, both high prevalence countries, meaning background risk is high. 
 Note that your CDC source is a recommendation for  global  HIV/AIDS programs i.e. it's not meant for the U.S., as the low prevalence here means that it would be scientifically unjustifiable to recommend routine infant circumcision (RIC) 
 The studies only showed reduction in transmission  from females to their male partners . It has not been shown to affect male-to-female transmission and it's possible that it could increase it, given that the loss of the gliding action of the foreskin results in increased friction during vaginal intercourse, which could result in increased vaginal tears that would make HIV transmission easier. Keep in mind that male-to-female transmission is much more likely than the reverse, which, depending on sexual practices, may mitigate any impact that this proposed ""intervention"" could have on the epidemic. 
 The studies were stopped short for ""ethical reasons"" because they had shown a benefit and could not ethically justify withholding the procedure from the people in the control group. 
 
 Controlled research trials almost always produce results suggesting greater effectiveness than results from large scale implementation. 
 Cutting trials short further biases a study's results (towards increased magnitude of benefit). 
 The claims of condoms to intervention group are bogus as far as I know; however, those in the experimental group (circumcised) did receive more counseling in terms of time and number of visits, which may further bias these studies. 
 I don't believe they were able to adequately control for differential condom use and it's plausible that the extra counseling may have resulted in increased condom use in the experimental group. 
 It's also plausible that having a reminder of the importance of HIV prevention (they knew the purpose of the study) that can be seen and felt every time they urinate or touch their penis or have sex, namely the lack of foreskin and presence of circumcision scar could also lead to safer sexual practices. 
 The studies also did not adequately control for the 6 weeks during which the experimental group was not supposed to have sex, which is a significant amount of the total study time (appx. 23%), given that it was cut short. 
 Given the shortened timeline, increased sensitivity, which is widely reported by adult males after undergoing circumcision and often lasts a few months, could also have been a significant factor. After all, if this initial increased sensitivity led to them achieving orgasm faster, it could mean that the sex they did have was much shorter, which would likely decrease risk of transmission. Frequency of intercourse I believe was measured, but not the length of time (this is incredibly hard to accurately measure from a researcher's perspective). 
 Their study only included people who were married (or at least in a stable long-term monogamous heterosexual relationship), decreasing the generalizability of any findings. 
 The studies actually found  increased  rates of female-to-male HIV transmission in males who did not wait the full 6 weeks. These results were glossed over and not part of the final analysis. 
 If it wasn't already obvious, the researchers' pro-circ bias is evident when they report, in subsequent papers studying HPV transmission in the same group, that female preference for circumcised penises as a further benefit to their recommendation. Aside from the moral implications of this, and aside from questions of its scientific relevance, for them to not consider the effect of their study itself (most people are going to know that the study is going on, and will have some idea of what it's about, even if they're not part of it) and the education they provided as part of it on the preferences of these women is decidedly  unscientific . 
 The authors don't really speculate on the possibility that it is likely that in the long-term, whatever benefits there are are likely to be significantly less than they've observed. Even if, as implied, being circumcised reduced the chance of acquiring HIV from a single act of unprotected heterosexual intercourse by 60%. 
 The authors are at least humble enough to admit (or at least they realize that they'd be torn to bits if they didn't) that any benefit is overshadowed by the benefits of proper use of condoms. Though they may be forgiven for not elaborating on this, it may be further evidence of their bias that they did not (or just journal word-limits), especially since the first response I hear to the condom argument is usually that it's really hard to get people to use condoms. This is true, but, condoms are already known to protect against all STDs (though the level of protection varies by disease). Condoms protect against male to female transmission as well as female to male transmission. And, condoms protect against pregnancy. They also didn't explicitly say that the circ benefit is not additive to that of the condom. If a condom is properly used by a circumcised man, the benefit is the same as for an intact man. 
 I think they do mention the fact that their results are probably not generalizable to low-prevalence areas, but they do it at the end of the discussion, which is often ignored as it's where the same old song and dance of ""more research is needed"" is placed. 
 They (recklessly, I think) did not consider the implications that this could have in the long run on beliefs about HIV risk and safe sex. Given that it's a still not uncommon belief that having sex with a virgin can cure HIV (and there are plenty of other myths), it's not hard to imagine that if this is implemented on a large scale, it could lead to the belief that sex with a circumcised man constitutes safe sex. It doesn't. If something along these lines develops, it could set back years of family planning and STI prevention efforts, not to mention HIV prevention. 
 These trials were done on adults, and that's where the main push has been, but they are being used to justify infant circumcision. While the risk of HIV transmission while the circumcision would is healing is (hopefully/probably) much lower in infants than adults, the risks of the procedure itself are also much higher (much smaller anatomy and generally just much more vulnerable). 
 
 Given these serious methodological issues, why would the WHO recommend it? Considering how uncritically the WHO page reports it (as though all the studies showed the same reduction), my guess is that they felt a compelling need to demonstrate some tangible advance in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, to secure more funding for the future, and they may have also felt pressure from governments who probably are desperate to prove to their citizens that they are doing something to combat HIV. A WHO stamp of approval probably makes it a hell of a lot easier to get more money for HIV programs. Given these pressures, it's probably not surprising that they were willing to overlook the fact that the evidence base really is very weak.","We're not anti-science. There are serious methodological issues with the studies. The WHO's promotion of circ probably has more to do with political pressure to find  something  that can help slow the HIV epidemic, than it does with the scientific legitimacy of these studies."

worldnews,co6e130,"There's a big difference between agreeing to a treaty and making it part of your constitution. Have you seen the HR declaration? It's shoddy at best. The U.S. had reservations about the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and applied them to the acceptance that states it's only prohibited in the same way the Constitution prohibits it, which the Supreme Court has kinda said torture isn't prohibited by the Constitution, since it's not a punishment handed down by a judge (cue 8th amendment not protecting against torture. 
 The U.S. accepted the Genocide Convention in the late 1980's under Reagan. 40 years after it was initially created. Because of de jure segregation and the fact that there was some concern what the U.S. was doing to blacks were red flags for potential genocide (along with many other political road blocks). 
 The U.S. hasn't even ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, (article 37), ""No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age."" 
 Sounds good, right? Nah. Missouri put to death-- (or life imprisoned, I've got Article 37 of the convention in front of me, but not the Missouri court case listed) Missouri put to death/life imprisoned a 16 year old kid after he was convicted of murder. Also, the Supreme Court has queued up to debate whether life imprisonment is the same thing as sentencing someone with 150 years in prison. 
 So it's not just as easy as ratifying the treat/convention, then implementing it. It's multiple things like, is this shit even any different than already listed, is it specific, do we agree with it? 
 A lot of Americans agree torture is okay, but the Constitution doesn't even explicitly protect us citizens from torture. The treaty was ratified to the specifications of the Constitution, so why would we add that to it if it's simply an extension of it/reassurance of it? 
 The HR Declaration is too broad and in-specific to really include it in the Constitution, so we'd be better off just stating what we need to have, and technically it's  already in the Constitution (/Declaration if Independence)  when we say people are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The 9th and 10th Amendments are specifically there to say that just because something isn't listed, doesn't mean it isn't a right people have, it's just not listed because   it's shorter to list a handful of protections and what gov't CAN'T do in a constitution than it is to list the millions+ things that we are allowed to do.","The Human Rights declaration is broad and inspecific, the U.S. makes the treaties conform to the Constitution anyways"

We, western nations, largely dictate the economic affairs of the world. We, western nations, largely put a blind eye to the crippling economic imbalances that allow for poverty to grip much of the Muslim world. Choice ""allies"" of the US fund schools whose sole purpose is to indoctrinate kids into seeing how we have taken for ourselves the best the world has to offer while leaving much of the world to rot and die silent, painful, hunger-filled deaths. They gladly fund these schools because they know that hatred can be guided to action, and once they give these now-grown children the funding and arms to make right in the world the only way they were taught, their actions are then maligned by the western world for we cannot see our hypocrisy for wishing to eradicate a problem that we start and continue every single day we do not keep in mind that people live harsh existences all over the world but mostly do so peacefully of their own accord, and the onus is on us, the ones with the power, to help the powerless. 
 If we wished for our citizens abroad to be treated well, we should treat the citizens of all nations as our equals. This is all a part of their plan to sustain the  cultural war we are waging. We can only continue to place these individuals beneath ourselves in our imagined hierarchy we have constructed by creating a barrier of cultural norms that we believe separates us from them. 
 We fail to see that throughout history those who wish to oppress a group of peoples desire to paint a certain picture of them and sell that to the masses. The last thing the western media wants to do is to create in the mindset of the American people the image that these individuals are misguided individuals who have been taught the ways of war by our own allies. 
 We claim to want to have women educated and have their voices heard, but what happened when Malala asked that the drone attacks on her countrymen and women stop? She was silenced, silently, the way our media knows best. It was content with hearing her harp on about the evils of the Taliban or extremist groups, but when the status quo was questioned she stopped getting invitations to speak so ""publicly"" about such issues she felt were pressing. 
 We cannot ever win the war against IS, because to do so would involve looking inwards to our own actions. Introspection is a dying art to many. Our consumption patterns waver only in the face of injury to our pocketbooks. We are blind to the lasting hate we sow when we refuse to help our brothers and sisters with even the simplest of things. 
 The IS is an ultra-militant version of many entities before it. Their constituents have been led to believe that they will lead a revolution in the region that will allow for their particular brand of ""culture"" to reign supreme. They have been taught that they can win such a war by force. 
 But importantly the core of the IS, their membership base, only came about because of the intolerable living conditions western hegemony and empire have created in that region of the world. Those recruited from Europe have been sold a romanticized ideal, but they are not blind to the injustices doled out by European greed and excess. They are the newly minted puppets led by pied pipers who know that they lead away the children that we have ignored and degraded. To have no supportive figures in your life is devastating enough. To have that be your reality in a nation that shuns you for your skin color is a reality too harsh for many to bear, and so they run with open arms to the promise of world where they might matter for once in their lives.

I will be extremely surprised if the great majority of Bitcoin users are not identified with relatively high confidence and ease in the near future. The confidence won’t be high enough to achieve convictions, but will be high enough to identify likely targets. Furthermore, identification will be retrospective, meaning that someone who bought drugs on Silk Road in 2011 will still be identifiable on the basis of the block chain in, say, 2020. These de-anonymization techniques are well known to computer scientists, and, one presumes, therefore to the NSA. I would not be at all surprised if the NSA and other agencies have already de-anonymized many users. It is, in fact, ironic that Bitcoin is often touted as anonymous. It’s not.

worldnews,ccymh9u,"Cost plus means cost plus fixed amount. You bid to the government showing them your estimated cost to complete the project and what your exact profit will be. That profit is all you get no matter what. 
 That's a bit of an oversimplification of Cost Plus.  There are different types of cost plus contracts.  Cost Plus-Fixed Fee is exactly what you described.  The contractor fee is fixed and any additional cost doesn't change that. 
 There is also Cost Plus - Incentive Fee that gives the contractor more money for meeting performance targets.  For example, if the contractor is asked to build a satellite, there will be a weight requirement.  There will be two weights listed, one is the threshold weight (that absolutely must be met) and another would be the target weight (what is desired).  If the contractor meets the target weight, they will get more money.  But targets can also be things like if you get to verification testing only using 20 million dollars, you get extra money for yourselves because you saved the government money.  So there is incentive for the contractor to save the government money.  Incentive Fee contracts will have clearly defined objective criteria to determine if contractors earn the extra money.  And for those of you that figured out you the contractor could spend endless money to reach the target and get extra profit, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) requires cost incentivds be tied to the performance incentives. 
 There is also Cost Plus -Award Fee which should have a more subjective critieria on whether the award is given but all the ones I've seen have objective critieria similar to incentive fee.  Most of the government contracts are award fee but the FAR clauses have requirements that must be met before an award fee contract can be given out. 
 Another type of Cost Plus is Award Term.  If they meet certain criteria, they are given more of the same type of work.  Say the contractor is supposed to build 20 drones in 2014.  If they do a good job, based on predetermined criteria, then they are award another contract to deliver 20 more drones in 2015. 
 Finally there is Cost Plus - Percentage of Cost.  This is the one where the contractor can make more money as cost goes up.   I have never seen this contract given out and from my understanding, it isn't even allowed. 
 So, yeah, the contractor isn't going to be making money DIRECTLY by raising costs.

 It also isn't true that Israeli policy is taboo in US politics and in the US media. It's so infrequently covered, because it doesn't represent anything new: the situation with palestine has been stagnant for years. Its the same reason why we don't hardly ever hear about the civil war in the Congo (and I would argue the latter is MUCH more atrocious). 
 It might be covered more if Israel's position had any chance of affecting our bilateral relations, but it doesn't, and not because it's anti semitic to criticize Israel.

We have been (and in fact, are) allied with much worse countries than Israel for much less in return.

worldnews,cexsd5h,"I feel like a ban of circumcision is not the correct route to go: you're treating a symptom of something greater. If we want to talk about human rights, then we need to talk about religious reform. 
 Most religions are thousands of years old and must be updated so that archaic practices, such as circumcision,  are not included. I feel that just placing a ban on circumcision is indeed a targetted and futile attempt to attack Jews when if we were to approach this issue properly, we would not only identify newborn circumcision  as an issue but would go more towards the problem with religious freedom. 
 Circumcision and other acts performed at early childhood (baptism also comes to mind) are the  result of the belief that children inherit the religion of their parents. This is where children's rights are violated.  Their bodies and minds are literally shaped so that they can be modeled in that god's chosen image for mankind, and it sets the stage for a form of brainwashing (depending on the level of orthodoxy) or future struggle with identity many face when they realize they dont care for their parent's religion. 
 I, for one, am a big proponent of the idea of religious freedom, where, when they are old enough, children can explore and choose what they want to believe.  Frankly, I think that many more people would become religious for this reason and that religions would be forced to ""modernize"" in order to attract new followers.","circumcision targets a symptom, not the problem, which is that children inherit the religion of their parents.

 When the crowd was approaching the officer line they were ordered to stop and then they did and just started chanting. The officers then approached the crowd and used LRAD devices to try to break up the crowd. When the crowd did not back away then then fired the teargas/smoke grenades.

About a minute later there were sounds coming from a bus that had about a dozen people arrested and handcuffed. 
 The people in the bus claimed they were 'arrested for no reason' however in the Official Statement they were arrested for ""Failure to disperse"". They however said that only 7-8 were arrested when in the Vice live-stream alone there was 12-20 people on a bus. Another currently being arrested.

 But the truth is - that US and UK news media is by far the most radical propaganda machine of any state ever devised - the people of East Germany and Soviet Russia at least knew and accepted that their news was official and highly suspect, westerners BELIEVE their news is independent and are there fore more able to maintain the facades that it is true and not propaganda allowing a much more insidious level of deciep.",Westerners are more influenced by state propaganda than anything anyone in Russia ever was  -  the evidence speaks for its self.

And I'm not really defending the morality of the behavior so much as I am trying to offer a reality of human behavior and that it's not always as easy to make the ""right"" decision as it looks on paper. To use a different example, what if I'm just a guy who delivers Nestle chocolate? Is it wrong to work for them because of their other business dealings that aren't in line with my morals? After all, I'm just delivering chocolate and if what the guys in the water division are doing is so bad, it would surely be illegal (speaking as the guy in my example, of course).

worldnews,c6721u2,"As an Egyptian muslim, there are a few things I noticed here in the media(whether television or people on the web) in the past 5 days: 
 
 The video has been on the web since July, there wasn't much done about it back then, and not a lot of people cared since that's how this type of trash should be treated. 
 Suddenly the video became viral, all Islamic channels on youtube who usually share videos about Religion related stuff, they all shared this one and even some uploaded it themselves. 
 It was common knowledge to some of those people that this movie was an official one, that it was going to be played on 9/11 as a national thing. 
 The night before 9/11 it was announced that they were going to ""protest"" the movie. 
 Mubarak's regime media(Some of them are still on air) were putting gas next to fire, they were acting really angry, some of them who never talk about these types of thing did a full show about it. Telling people that they need to show their anger.

worldnews,cqf94el,"The question is how to assess a teacher, while taking into account that students may fail by their own misbehavior as opposed to poor teaching skills. 
 So that's when you look at the average test scores for each subject, and for each teacher, and for each grade level, all across the state i.e.: standardized testing. 
 You say the move from subject to subject is wild. That is true. But what you do is this: 
 In 2010, test all students across the state, and analyze avg test scores across the state, district, school, student economic background, city population, and teacher. 
 If you see that Ms. Jones consistently yields students, year after year, with lower-than-average test scores in Algebra I when compared to her school, district, and state, you can see that she isn't a good teacher. This is in contrast with Ms. Perfect's algebra II classes, who seems to consistently provide higher-than-average test scores when compared to her school, district, and state. Expect for maybe year 2012, that was a crappy year for her class Algebra II class. In fact, if you look at the test scores for Ms. Jones Algebra I class in 2011, you can see that she had lower-than usual test averages when compared to her previous years of teaching. This shows its not necessarily the teacher's fault. 
 Maybe you argue that teachers may appear below average if they teach in a troubled area. Well, they won't, because it would be better to compare her test scores to other teachers who also teach in troubled areas. Maybe a teacher teaches in a rural town, with 8 students in her class. So you also compare her scores to other students from rural towns with low class-sizes. 
 Of course, you'll need to analyze after a few years. After then, you'll be able to re-train or re-hire teachers. 
 And that's why there are many states with standardized testing. Your school will look terrible if you don't fix the test scores/teachers. The real problem is when standardized tests interfere with the teacher's style of teaching. 
 Perhaps the teacher knows her students won't be able to learn all of algebra the state will test over, but can teach them the basics and enough to get through with life. However, with standardized testing, you'll have to ""teach the test,"" and may end up with students barely passing, but not being able to understand the concepts of what they are doing- they end up memorizing a pattern, as opposed to learning how to discover patterns.","Standardized testing will get you all the data you need to evaluate a teacher. It may also hinder teaching, which is counterproductive."

I think the issues sorrounding Jerusalem are complex. Both Israel and all Palestinian factions claim Jerusalem as their capitol. More extreme Palestinian factions claim ALL of Jerusalem (some 500K Jews and 300K Palestinians) while more moderate Palestinian factions claim only East Jerusalem - the majority arab neighborhoods of the city. They feel that eventually a Palestinian state would incorporate Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem as its capitol. Left wing and more moderate Israelis accept this, while right-wing and extremist Israelis believe that ALL of Jerusalem should remain the capitol of Israel even after the creation of a Palestinian state. 
 Jerusalem is a city like any other with organic evolution - such as young professionals moving to (and gentrifying) poorer areas, real estate developers buying up and developing land in less expensive parts of the city as an investment, or buildings being built on undeveloped/empty land (fields etc). Most of these undeveloped areas are in East Jerusalem. 
 As part of the peace process Israel has not been issuing permits to those who want to construct there. IE: allow Jews to purchase land from Palestinians and construct apartment blocks/neighboorhoods there that are generally too expensive for most arabs to own. 
 While this is going on, right wing Israeli politicians and other radical israeli groups have attempted to establish ""facts on the ground"" - so that when in the future there is a Palestinian state, more neighborhoods of Jerusalem will be majority Jewish. 
 With unrestricted capitalism this is very easy to do. Generally Israeli citizens have access to more money than non-Israeli palestinians and can buy land / construct buildings on it. However for obvious reasons Palestinian factions do not approve of this. If neighborhoods in East Jerusalem become majority Jewish, how could they be part of the capitol of the Palestinian state? 
 It's detrimental to the peace process for Israeli to issue permits on contentious land. However there's a lot of domestic pressue for Israeli politicans to do so. For example the settlement listed above ""Givat Hamatos"" is a majority Etheopian owned village (can you even use that term?) of mobile homes. Basically a trailer park. Most of the families living there are rather poor and cannot afford to live in other areas of the city. There is domestic pressure for Israel to approve the construction of homes and more permanant dwellings for these people. 
 On the one hand these homes would be in neighborhoods claimed by the Palestinian Authority as East Jerusalem. On the other hand the trailer park is already mostly Jewish and the building of homes would not increase the population - just increase the quality of life for the Etheopian immigrants living there. 
 When the PA does something in its self interest that Israel doesn't approve of, it makes it easier for Israel to cave into domestic pressure and do something the PA doesn't approve of. Until there is a meaningful peace process, stuff like this will keep happening.","the issue is complex and without a meaningful peace process neither ""side"" will be happy."

 Think of it this way.

 How about the many non-violent protests going on across the Middle East right now? Libya is different, it's civil war over there. But across the Middle East there are moderate voices trying to get equal rights, freedom of expression and laws that prohibit the infringement of human rights. Take Bahrain for example, where the moderates have led the protests - and the government has been the violent one. But you don't hear much about what's happening in Bahrain because it's a US ally, and so you say ""Where are those pacifists?"" instead. 
 One thing you must understand is that 'liberal' is relative. A common example is that what is considered left in American politics is on the right in UK politics.

 > Does an Arab Muslim identify him/herself and an Arab first or a Muslim first or neither, or both or is it pretty much the same as saying Irish Catholic or Tibetan Buddhist? 
 Personally, I consider myself an Arab first, but Muslim culture is definitive of Arab culture. I don't see how this is relevant to anything though. 
 > What I'm interested in knowing is it their religion dictates the ferocity of action or is it the norm for being Middle Easterner. 
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but what you're asking is: ""Is violence inherent in being Muslim, or is it inherent in being Arab?"" The question comes across as somewhat naive to me, as you're implying that violence (or 'ferocity of action', to use your words) is a way of life. 
 One thing you don't seem to understand is that it's very difficult to generalise with Arabs. The Middle East isn't as diverse as Europe, but it's not nearly as homogeneous as the US. The Persian Gulf and its history is one of fishermen, pearl divers, pirates, Iran and British Protectionism. But it does not share the history of native Berbers, wars fought for the supremacy of the Mediterranean sea and European colonialism that has helped define North Africa (the Maghrib) over the centuries. The history of Lebanon is uniquely shaped by the country's proximity to Europe and it's large Christian population. The Kurdish plight is a part of Syria, Iraq and Turkey, but not the rest of the Middle East. Palestine is marketed by the Middle Eastern media as the great struggle of Muslims and Arabs, but Palestine and Israel's history - and the thousands of refugees made over its course - is far more relevant to Israel's neighbours of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon than anyone else. Sectarian issues are more prominent in Lebanon (christians/sunnis/shia), Iraq (sunnis/shia/kurds) and Bahrain (sunnis/shia) than in other countries. In historic terms, the last time a single Arab empire stood was during the Abbasid Caliphate, which ruled Spain, North Africa, the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Arabian Peninsula and Persia. That was approximately 1200 years ago. After that, the Arab/Muslim world was split into at least two empires. Even the Ottoman empire had contemporary rivals such as the Mamluks and Safavids. 
 My point is, it's impossible to be general with this question/answer without completely ignoring the breadth of difference between the Arabs and their history. So to return to your question: is it religion or nationality that dictates the violence witnessed? 
 It's neither. It's entirely situational. Libya is an all-out civil war at the moment, and TheCeilingisGreen puts it better than I could: 
 > I see all these comments about muslims and I wonder what anyone of any religion would do after being terrorized by snipers who shot your loved ones just for walking through your city square. If anyone thinks they and their community would react different after such terror is naive. 
 In Lebanon, some of the greatest atrocities of its civil war were carried out by the local Christians. Christian militia stormed Palestinian refugee camps and out-right massacred the people there. In Palestine, it was a people who had been persecuted in their own homeland for 3 generations and hardened by Israeli action that voted Hamas into parliament in 2006. That same year, the moderate opposition party, Al-Wefaq, got the majority of votes in Bahrain, while the hard-line opposition party as yet has little traction. 
 It's all situational. Where there has been greater persecution and sectarianism, there has been greater violence - and that violence escalates. This is not unique to the Middle East at all, but why this is prevalent in the Middle East... well, that might require an explanation as long as my last one, but the",version is that it's suffering the long term effects of colonialism.

worldnews,c8q5fup,"Indian lawyer here, just sharing some perspective to everyone crying foul: 
 
 Indian patent law did not even permit product patents (as opposed to process patents) for drugs and pharmaceuticals until 2005. If you can manufacture the same medicine in a substantially different way, you could do it. 
 
 The reasoning being that when it comes essential commodities like medicine, the immediate public need for a country like India was to ensure that the general public has easy access to medicines and not to ensure that the inventor of the medicine was able to exploit (term exploit being used objectively and without value judgement) his invention sufficiently. Yes, innovation would be stifled but there is an immediate public need in India and this is not some patent for a car or computer or smartphone but one for medicine. 
 
 Its only in 2005 that product patents were permitted subject certain conditions one of which was compulsory licensing (Section 92A of the Patents Act, 1970). This was invoked in exceptional circumstances where the drug becomes absolutely unavailable to the general public due to exorbitant over-pricing. 
 
 The other Novartis case mentioned in the article - their new application just got rejected for evergreening (industry practice of companies extending their patent monopolies by making fractionally different modifications of known compounds), which is prohibited in India. A new form of a known medicine can only be patented if it shows significantly improved therapeutic efficacy over existing compounds and the onus is on the patent applicant to demonstrate the improved therapeutic efficacy (Section 3(d) of the same Act).","India's patent laws permit the rape of drug companies who exorbitantly over-price or abuse their monopoly.

worldnews,cetljng,"Good question! 
 With regard to the fuel They know roughly where it is. We just don't know the exact state and location. 
 Aside from that, to maintain a critical nuclear reaction you need geometry, moderation, and enrichment (similar to how fire needs oxygen heat and fuel). Without the correct combination of these, criticality is impossible. 
 After the fuel and control rods melted you lost geometry. The control rods mixing in with the fuel material also effectively reduces enrichment (along with poisoning the chain reaction). Additionally boron has been added to the water further preventing criticality. 
 Criticality has not occurred since the earthquakes have hit and reactor protection system scrammed the reactors. To further add to this, if the fuel material was critical, it would be producing large amounts of heat. This can be easily measured by looking at the cooling system heat rejection rates. 
 But the ultimate way to know that criticality is not occurring, is measurements of iodine and xenon both in the cooling water and the air. These are both below the lower limit of detection at all 3 units. These isotopes have short half lives and are all decayed away, and they are only produced when fission is occurring in meaningful amounts. Tepco monitors these isotopes constantly, as that's their way of ensuring criticality has not occurred.","iodine and xenon not being detected means no critical reaction is occurring. 
 Edit 
 I understand this is an older link but if you search for ""criticality"" you will see they have boron injection along with criticality detection and alarming systems for the reactor and containment chamber.

 However, I cannot accurately portray every single reason I think the middle class is being destroyed into a comment box that people will willfully read. I did summarize below. 
 So, my replies come out in bits and pieces. 
 I take it as describing a nuclear reactor (I'm not in that field!). If I explain how to turn it on, it doesn't explain how the rest of the machine works. There are other components to it, but I can only mention so much. 
 In this case, I was referring to the idea people are overworked. If a company could hire someone for 5 dollars to come in, work for 1 hour, and alleviate those over worked people, that would be ideal for the company, the employees, etc. 
 However, law states business must pay X amount of money and quite often, an employer says ""not worth it"" and so the existing employee gets more labor. As well, the very low paying job doesn't exist (see inflation regarding why low pay is such an issue). 
 It's not destroying the middle class but it actually keeps poor people poor, ironically. Especially those who earn 0 income. As the cost of living increases, those with 0 income have everything come more expensive. Nothing is addressing inflation and minimum wage doesn't either. 
 Again, we can dissect the idea of inflation and ask why a quarter isn't worth the same as it once was. It goes on and on.","There are a lot of reasons but my simplistic mind reduces it to Government interference, a corporate run society care of Government approval, and a lack of freedom care of Government fear of it.

This is just elected officials, and does not take into account the organization surrounding them. The House of Commons also has a staff of 2000 people.

They got it and it's still not open today a decade later)  Then today occurred where all kinds of people are in arms against the cops for having to take action. Against a court injunction. The natives made it very clear they brought bows arrows and Molotov cocktails to a supposed peaceful protest. No they aren't guns but it's definitely intent and going to incite the cops. Don't bring weapons to a peaceful protest then get up in arms about retaliation when you set a cop car on fire. 
 I knew what was going to happen.  because young zealots who can't even speak their native tongues have some thing to prove ruining it for the actual beneficial and peaceful people. I was literally just informed a couple cars full of natives are heading to there right now from the reserve across from my town to ""support our brothers against those fucking racist pigs"" 
 And if you think this sounds racist try growing up near a reserve. If something doesn't go as planned its always racism racism racism. White people and the government hate us. 
 They are the most isolated out of date culture and then cry foul when they aren't given everything they need by the government because refusing to assimilate with Canadians and moving off reserve is somehow not an option.",no one hates the natives peacefully protesting and I commend them for it. they are the only people doing anything. Everyone hates fraking. And don't call everyone racist when you say you're having a peaceful protest but you bring Molotov cocktails to the party and people lose sympathy.
worldnews,crkc6v5,"END NOTE:
If you are looking for somewhere to go with your own path after reading this. I suggest modifying your face book feed to start incorporating news articles from independent journalists. I suggest you look around on reddit a bit more at some alternate news subs like endlesswar and wikileaks. Yes places like /r/conspiracy have their fair share of shit articles, but they have some real eye opening gems as well. Want to get off the internet for a while? Read 1984 and Animal Farm by George Orwell or Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. 
 Articles or interviews with Glenn Greenwald, and Noam Chomsky are also a great start. If your looking for a laugh after reading something this heavy, you need to look at the works of Bill Hicks and George Carlin.
Finally, when confronted with this information I often get asked, “Wtf do I do now that I know all this”.
I get asked this question every time i share this view point. I definitely think revolution is necessary. The system is inherently flawed and exploitable by psychopaths and negative human nature.
I am not a socialist or communist or democratic person. I think humans haven't quite got a system that is in balance with nature quite figure out yet. Watch zeitgeist, they go into a concept of a resource based economy, which i definitely am sold on being the only logical way forward. Every other system so far has fallen out of equilibrium with the environment. I think in zeitgeist 2 and 3 they go into it. 
 Revolution needs to be done peacefully. There’s a few great John Lennon quotes that come to mind ""When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system’s game. The establishment will irritate you – pull your beard, flick your face – to make you fight. Because once they’ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don’t know how to handle is non-violence and humor."" John Lennon
Heres another great one: ""Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. ... I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it."" - John Lennon Thats why Ghandi was so effective.... He didnt feed into them trying to incite violence.
So, i believe we are in a phase of pre revolution on a global scale. Alot of people see it coming, its coming one way or the other, i mean we are on a time limit here on how much longer the earth can support this current economic model before we kill ourselves. 
 So for now, i protest. Any chance i get. I basically try and wake as many people up as i can. Its a numbers game. All we need to do to win, is have enough people to do what iceland did. Just walk up to parliament house or the white house or whatever. And declare in 1voice, your fired. You work for us, you are fired.
re draw new constitutions with much more technical concepts for a new age. i think the concept of a new foundation of law should essentially be, a frame work for what laws WE CANT MAKE. As in, a new framework that focuses solely on equality, civil liberties and equilibrium with the environment. Just my 2 cents...
SO for now, i think your best bet is education. Education is the key, thats why we are winning. Because we have unlimited information. At our fingertips. Educate yourself on how things are working, delve into history a bit. Keep tabs on current political movements and geo political movements. Just learn something new every day. Then share that information with people. Help wake others up 
 Its just a ripple effect. I help educate 20 people, they each help educate another 20. It compounds exponentially rapidly. This is all coupled with people becoming self aware… And its getting easier to do it. This used to be such a taboo topic, it still is. it was SOOO much easier to dismiss this notion 20 years ago or even 10 years ago....
When there is a clear voice of NOOOO from the people to these crazy legislative measures around the world, which is synchronising so coincidentally and obviously, it is making it more and more obvious what is happening. That governments in most places are not listening to the people. That they keep representing the richest people on the planet whilst masquerading as democracy. Its become easier to see now.","Educate yourself, be positive, protest anything and everything that takes your interest (its really fun), share the information and help create a peaceful revolution in our lifetime."

The balance of power and borders set in place by treaties after the First World War are not necessarily what I would call natural. I think the Kurds should have a state and the Sunnis and Shiites certainly shouldn't be within a rifle shot of each other for any reason. Change is painful. It's unfortunate. But the sectarian ethnic undercurrent to this conflict cannot be ignored. Those involved certainly don't ignore it. A generation of pain for a future of peace? That's a tough call to make. I'm glad I don't have to make it.
Edit: the vacuum after Saddam and the other dictators had to be filled. Some could argue our responsibility is to let things play out naturally. I would argue that our responsibility is to make sure the right people come out of the vacuum to build a new Middle East. It's a new status quo. Things like the Marshall Plan which helped Europe rebuild after the Second World War in order to have a chance of resisting communist aggression have  not had any success  (Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.) in helping Middle Eastern countries resist extremism and sectarian violence.

My first day in the U.A.E I was detained for 6 hours and interrogated as to why I wanted to come to the U.A.E to work. At the end I was let go and told by the official that they hate Americans and I should watch my back (2009). I assumed it was just a weird first experience but things only got worse. During my first week in the U.A.E the house servant in the apartment next to me was heard screaming at the top of her lungs and crying out for help. When I called the police they did nothing except to do a full search of my apartment and fine me for having an extinct fire extinguisher. Later found out that the woman was being raped and this is a very common occurrence. Housekeepers (usually women from Bangladesh or Malaysia ) are looked up and have their passports taken away. Without a passport they cannot buy a phone to call for help and can be arrested for being out of the apartment without their ""sponsers"" approval. While the U.A.E. states that they have hotline for abused woman and workers to call, everyone that needs help has no way to call these numbers (not to mention they are not publically listed). Before I left I bought a bunch of sim cards and handed them out to the women in our new apartment (left the old one). 
Every hotel in the U.A.E generally has a floor dedicated to prostitution. They are women kidnapped and shipped in during special holidays that are then used, abused, and left with no way to get home but to continue with prostitution. Every emirate also has a labor camp, miles of tents on the outstretch of town where they house cheap labor workers. Again, these workers are brought in to work in the U.A.E under false pretenses then they have their passport stolen and are forced to work for wages that keep them in debt.

 The ocean is a complicated ecosystem and it's not like you can just drop iron in and grow stuff.  While growing, the organisms also use other nutrients like nitrate and phosphate, the availability of which sometimes limits the growth of algae or plankton. 
 It turns out that there is a lot of nitrate and phosphate in the southern ocean near antarctica, and also that is where a lot of cold water sinks to the bottom of the atlantic and the pacific, the problem is that the climate down there is so inhospitable that nothing grows (which is why there is a lot of nitrate and phosphate), even if you add a lot of iron.","Iron seeding will not work.

worldnews,cova391,"That's never going to happen. The US is fully committed to the Sunni states. at best the US will ratchet down the pressure on Iran, but no more than that. 
 a brief overview of the M.E 
 there are two major factions in the M.E. Sunni and Shiia. the US backs the Sunni.
Those Sunni countries being Saudi, Egypt, Kuwait. 
the Shiia being Iran, Iraq, Syria, Bahrain. 
 It's all about the ability to control access to the worlds most plentiful source of energy. 50% of the worlds oil is sourced from the M.E. 
 [Here's a real US policy doc from 1955. Take note of the objectives. Its not mythical. Its there in black and white.  ]( 
 Americas number one objective in the Middle East:  The availability to the US and its allies of resources, the strategic positions and the passage rights and the denial of such rights and resources to the soviet block. 
 So in 1955 the US sought to control the Gulf, to have the ability guarantee its access and to deny access to others.  Oil has not become less important in the prevailing 60 years. 
 Formally the USSR was the rival and was seen off with the help of Israel, ( It was what proved Israels worth to the US ) Iran was a client. Iran is no longer a client and so currently the US would like to prevent the formation of  the a [ Shiia crescent, ]( with Iran at its head. 
 This crescent would include the Shiia land in Saudi. This is why Saudi and Iran are implacable enemies. Saudi is a US client for protection against Iran. [ If you look and Shiia land in Saudi ]( you'll note it sits on top of the [ big oil fields ]( ""Find Shiia find oil"" is a local saying. The Shiia are the potential rivals to US hegemony in the gulf. 
 Should Iran succeed in creating such an entity this would be a genuine threat to Americas passage rights and strategic positions in the  region, which as you will recall is America #1 objective in the M.E. 
 The US will seek to control the M.E. so long as oil powers the world. Control of this resource is a major plank in the USA's super power status. 
I don't think there is a better ally in this ambition to control the gulf than Israel. Israel is a western enclave in the region, is a regional pariah completely dependent on the US for weapons and coverage from UN sanctions and proven ability to kick arab ass. Who would be better? 
 If you view everything in the M.E. through a Sunni/Shiia/Oil lens all becomes clearer. 
 The US state dept has called Saudi and the description can be extended to the region [ “a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history.” ]( 
 [Zbigniew Brzezinski]( former United States National Security Advisor said America's control over the Middle East [ ""gives America indirect but politically critical leverage on the European and Asian economies that are also dependent on energy exports from the region."" ]( . [George Kennan]( put is as ""Veto power"". Truman's Secretary of Defense James Forrestal noted that [ “whoever sits on the valve of Middle East oil may control the destiny of Europe” ]( and now Asia. 
 Control the M.E and you have your foot on the windpipe of the European and Asian economies. relinquishing that control is  unthinkable. (Having permanent military bases in Iraq makes very good sense in this context ) relinquishing control to an Iranian shiia block /China/ Russia is doubly unthinkable. All other potential rivals have to figure Americas control of the oil flow into their calculations. The USA controls the oil. If the USA decides, say China, will not be getting M.E. oil then it can stop the flow. China knows this, the USA knows this. Thus before things get violent China will have to back down. ( China used for example only ) 
 BTW China is taking steps strengthen the sea route from the Gulf to China, [ the string of pearls naval ports ](","if you look at any conflict in the M.E. look at the sides, Shiia and Sunni, I'll find the US will back the Sunni as they have oil and use the Petro$ 
 Edit: more on petro$ 
 The use of the petro$ means that the US can print dollars to pay for price increases in oil. Industrialized countries without oil, such as Japan EU or China, have to export to the US in order to obtain dollars to exchange for Opec oil; for example, cars in the case of Japan. So America gets oil and services and goods (eg cars) in exchange for pieces of paper. Not only that but Opec's excess dollars were then reinvested in the US and other industrialized countries, thus funding the US budget deficit and reducing US interest rates. 
 It would be a massive blow to lose the petrodollar. If no one bought US$ anymore I wonder how far it would drop in value"

 Why bother?  Fringies never win?  you may ask? 
 Aside for the snowballing tendency for political support (more people will give a party consideration proportional to their perceived growth in polling), something else happens when you vote for ""alternative"" parties -  the mainstream takes notice. 
 For instance, the Democrats might change their tune (and their priorities) if they lost a substantial number of votes to more radical, left leaning parties (whether they be Fabian socialists, through to outright communists.)  Those are votes which (nationwide) could keep losing them seats to Republican candidates.

worldnews,cpzegtt,"It would be expensive but their are two things that would help offset that. 
One, is that airlines could employ a reduced number of pilots. A pilot could take off a plane, set it to autopilot, switch to a different plane on the ground, then switch back to the first plane when it has to land or in an emergency.
Two, is that theoretically passengers could bypass the majority of the TSA screening process. Because these planes can't be hijacked from inside the plane, weapon restrictions could be removed. Large explosive would still have to be screened for but that is much easier than screening for small items like a pocket knife or ammunition. 
 As for the latency issue, I believe the way the Predator system works now is that once the aircraft is close enough a direct connection is established between the control unit and the aircraft. This reduces the latency of the connection to the point where the pilot can land the aircraft in the same manner as he would if he was physical on the aircraft. 
 As for society, I doubt if people fully understand autopilot of fly by wire but they still them. It would be novel at first and Fox news and CNN would make a big deal out of it but after a while people would get used to it.

worldnews,clemu16,"I could not agree with you more based on my own personal beliefs. The ones that say that we should normalize living in a world where everyone is considered equal. Where we teach acceptance & where we allow for each individual to succeed no matter their race, gender, creed, ect. 
 Here's the issue though. 
 Based on the current role that religion plays in society people still uphold many of religions beliefs and traditions. A first world principal is to allow for each person to freely be able to practice their religion. 
 However we've seen that certain laws (like the ones in France) have been created that prevent certain religious practices. The justifications behind these decisions are usually rooted in first world ideology as well. Such as creating equality among the population, or for security purposes. 
 What laws like the ones in France have done is establish restriction on the practice of religion. Which creates a catch-22 for those who subscribe to freedom of religion. It no longer becomes freedom of religion & instead becomes freedom of religion within the law. 
 One can say that restrictions on religion have been occurring since the beginning of religion and this is just the next step in that process. We no longer allow for ten year old's to wed, and we no longer stone people to death (most of us at least). This is just the next step on the evolutionary scale of tolerance and acceptance. I agree. 
 The question is where does the line get drawn though? 
 Wouldn't it be justifiable for the Muslim community to say that they are being discriminated against by being restricted from practicing their religion while other's have no restrictions. Take the religious Jewish women who conceal their hair with wigs as one example. Or take the Catholic nuns who are allowed to walk around with their hair covered as well. 
 Based on France's desire to create ""equality"" are those people not as guilty of creating inequality, as the women wearing the hijab or naqib? One might say they aren't covering the face, and we are focusing on the face here. As long as they don't cover there face they are fine. 
 Ok, I concede that those examples are different because they are only concealing their hair, not their faces. However they are still not creating the harmonious society that France is trying to establish. 
 Continuing with that ideology as the motive, the more harmonious a society you try to create, the less you allow for individual freedoms. The primary example of this would be Socialism/Communism in the U.S.S.R or Fascism/Nazism in Nazi Germany. Both believed that restrictions on freedoms were needed in order to create a harmonious society. Obviously these are two extreme examples, but one can only wonder if the evolutionary scale of tolerance/acceptance eventually leads us there. 
 If we are truly interested in achieving equality, is it not the final chapter in the quest? The one that says we are all equal, because we are all the same. 
 Many people, particularly on reddit, subscribe to no religion and believe the world would be a better place without religion. I agree as well. Let's assume that there was a country that was acting based on the same motives as France was when they outlawed the niqab, and they decided that they wanted to outlaw all forms of religious dress. Then they wanted to outlaw all practices of religion, then they wanted to outlaw religion all together. 
 Many people who want to live in the first world, would say that this would be the greatest leap to achieving life in the first world. A John Lennon like utopia....Imagine. 
 However, wouldn't this be the complete opposite of freedom? Wouldn't it be totalitarianism? The state controlling us in order to achieve a society that is equal. 
 So what do we do? How can we live by the first world principal that says each person should be free to practice their religion/belief/way of life and the first world principal of equality/security/unity? 
 The answer we arrive at, is sort of the system we currently have today. Which is ad-lib as you go. The acceptance of homosexuality and gay marriage being one of the best examples of this kind of governance. 
 I believe that eventually the desire for equality will trump the desire to protect people's freedoms. The question is, which is better? 
 That I do not have an answer for.","Equality is great, but it eventually restricts peoples freedoms. Finding the right balance between the two is hard, and universal laws/practices are unable to address the issues. When trying to live in the first world, the catch-22 of believing in freedom of religion & believing in equality get intertwined in a no-win scenario. What's the solution? Seems like the ad-lib as you go plan, makes the most sense, and hope society evolves based on their beliefs and not those imposed by the state."

worldnews,colytw5,"Biologist here! 
 Virulence as a term can be confusing because it is often used to describe both disease  severity  and disease  infectivity . These concepts are closely related! For example, the flu (Influenza) is infectious  because  it causes symptoms such as sneezing and coughing (which contribute to its severity). So, some amount of virulence is good (from the perspective of the virus), but there is a point past which the virus will start to get diminishing returns. For example, lets imagine an influenza that caused someone to be completely bedridden immediately after they first contract the disease. First of all, that would suck. But that's also bad for the virus! It doesn't ""want"" its hosts to be bedridden! Evolutionarily speaking, the virus would like its hosts to walk around and spread the virus to new hosts! The more hosts it has, the less likely it will be wiped out. 
 Remember, evolutionary success rides on how well an individual passes on its genes - not how awesome it is. So, you might ask,  what's the most successful virus? 
 I don't know about a specific virus that is most successful, but I would argue that [endogenous retroviruses]( have been most successful overall. What is an endogenous retrovirus? Well, some viruses, such as HIV, are retroviruses. This means that they use a protein called reverse transcriptase to take their RNA and convert it into DNA. Your cells say ""Oh hey, there's a random strand of DNA floating around here! [I'm going to put it in my chromosomes!!!""]( Then the virus does its trojan horse impersonation and makes lots of copies of itself. Go figure. 
 Well, sometimes when the cell incorporates the viral DNA into its genome, the virus gets  stuck . This means that when the cell divides, it'll copy the viral DNA with it. Occasionally this is ""intentional"", and the virus will become active many generations down the line when something in the environment triggers it (kind of like a [sleeper agent]( Other times it happens by accident, and the virus gets deactivated somehow. Now, in most cells that's not a big deal. But what if it gets stuck in an egg or sperm cell? 
 Well, it turns out that between 5-10% of your DNA is viral in origin (the variance is because we aren't entirely sure what is and what isn't viral in origin). And that's not just humans. That's basically every animal, plant, fungus, everything. In fact, you can trace our evolutionary history by comparing which viral sequences we have in common with different kinds of organisms. As evolutionary biology would predict, we share most of the same sequences with chimps, a high amount of sequences with mice, a smaller amount with flies, and so on. It's viruses all the way down.","Viruses generally need their hosts to survive in order to spread!

 I am from Brazil, our last Emperor believed republic was a good idea, although first his idea was just to have a parliament, after he abolished slavery, the landowners got pissed and told him they wanted a presidential republic... 
 Our Emperor thought the idea was nice, and voluntarily stepped down, since then Brazil overall declined (although obviously our GDP, population and other numbers are higher than 1850, we don't build infrastructure as the king did for example, half of all our current railroads were built by the emperor, our tech powerhouse cities were setup by the emperor, some of our best research institutes were setup by the emperor, and so on...) 
 After the Emperor stepped down we had: 
 A fake republic (presidents were always from the same group of friends, and kept getting elected with 99% of the votes), then a fascist guy did a coup to get rid of the fake republic (and in turn he fixed lots of things...) then he lost power (partly for being a fascist), then we had some very unstable republic (with resignations, suicidal president, moving the capital away from the masses, several changes between parliamentarism and presidentialism...) that got toppled by CIA in 1964, and replaced by a US-aligned military dicatorship... 
 The dictatorship again fixed lots of things that were being done wrong, but at the same time they were brutal and evil (example: kidnapped lots of people, exploded civilians in ""terrorist"" false flag operations, torture, and let the CIA ""disappear"" people) 
 Yet, near the end, the last dictator (they changed dictator every 5 years) warned that with him gone, the masses would elect certain parties, that will make people regret going back to democracy. 
 Indeed, that guy was right, since the dictatorship ended, a single party has been dominating politics, and they are doing that by abusing the system outright, they don't even have a ideology, they just want power, and they don't even hide that fact, they keep acting as puppetmasters behind left-wing parties (although they are not necessarily left-wing themselves) and as result we had a string of presidents that made our economy highly unstable (we had 3000% inflation, then periods rapidly alternating recession with high growth, and after the 2008 crisis the government tried to fix it making the same mistakes that led to 2008 crisis in first place, and now it exploded in our hands and Brazil in 2015 is finally feeling the effects of 2008 full blown, the president approval is hovering around 15%, the elections are suspected to be totally faked, our current election system was DESIGNED to allow faked elections, and there has been protests to kick out the government, including some that want the dictators back).","Ever since Brazil king voluntarily stepped down and allowed republic to take place, Brazil started to alternate between fake republics (rigged elections), brutal dictators, or the masses making extremely stupid decisions."

The 3 Jewish teens being found murdered after a massive ""Bring our boys home"" campaign that went viral in Israel. They wanted those kids back so badly because they basically became the face of all Israeli kidnap and terrorist victims. They thought public pressure would force them to be released. They honestly did not expect to find them dead. The nation was angered and devastated. But that alone did not start this war. A Jewish extremist(s) brutally killed a Palestine kid.

worldnews,can53z4,"I just got home, I was at the protest in Rio, the biggest of them all, there was about 800,000 people there. Let me explain it to you from a brazilian point of view... When you think Brazil, you think soccer, especially with all the World Cup business going on, right? Well, I bet you'd never have thought that the president of Brazil would get the everloving crap BOOED out of her by the population in the grand opening of the FIFA Confederations Cup. The brazilian people are tired of living in a country where THIRTY BILLIONS went to prepare for the goddamn World Cup, while our health care system has gone to hell and sick people are laying on the floor of hospital hallways in endless queues, while the public education system serves our children rotten food at school because it's cheaper and leaves more money to spare for the corrupt government. Of course, the income concentration in Brazil is one of the most unequal in the world, where the upper 20% of the population holds 57,7% of the money and the LOWER 40% HOLDS 11%, according to IBGE! Meaning the rich (or even the middle class) can afford private health care and education (just so you have an idea, the disparity between the public and private education systems is so huge that the government had to create a set percentile of slots for public school students as their only chance of getting into university, since they COULD NOT EVEN HOPE to compete on even ground with private school students). Which is probably why you haven't heard of many political manifestations in Brazil. When the dominant classes are content, why protest? But getting back to the World Cup, Brazil didn't have the infrastructure necessary to host it. We had to build several stadiums, just to show the world what a great developing economy we are and how we can soooo host a World Cup like all those first world countries. Investing on the actual needs of brazilian people, ain't nobody got time for that! And what is the most sickening is their ''hosting the World Cup will help the social development of Brazil'' speech… not happening, people, all the outside investments attracted by the World Cup will benefit only the upper economic classes, as long as the income concentration doesn't even out, heck, as long as there isn't an actual effort from the government to service the population in need instead of using resources to feed their corrupt schemes. And why do we even need a World Cup to grow, when they could've been helping us with the money leeched off of our taxes all along? No joke, the average tax per product bought in Brazil is from 30% to 40%. When you buy a TV, 45% goes in taxes. The government raised over a trillion of reais (brazilian money unit) in taxes in 2012. Maybe we'd actually believe in the government using money from outside investors to help us if they had made better use of our own money. But no, they're corrupt as heck. Several people linked to the Lula administration, including minister José Dirceu, the highest-ranking member of the Executive Office of Brazil (composed of ministers of state and senior advisors) were exposed in a scandal of national proportions just a few years ago. The ex-president swore he was clueless as to what his subordinates and fellow political party members had been up to, which makes him grossly incompetent at best and as corrupt as them at worst. Just so you can have an idea, President Dilma and Lula's party, the PT, spent TEN MILLIONS in buying the political support of an opposing party, the PTB, roughly 150,000 to each representative. Now, the support of the millions of people earning up to 140 reais a month (about the price of the clothes worn by your average spoiled middle class teen), they buy with programs of social assistance like Bolsa-Família, through which they take people from extreme poverty by giving them the bare money necessary to feed themselves. Yeah, what about education, health, housing, employment, security? Those poor grateful people have no idea of how much more the government owes them. Let's talk security. To say Brazil has issues with drug traffic would be a gross understatement. Police units are going inside the favelas (poor communities where drug traffic is the reigning order) and taking away these criminals… to clean up for the World Cup. Yeah, you heard me right. Because, you know, it would be bad propaganda to leave crime for tourists to see, but no worries, they're gonna be released afterwards… BECAUSE FCK THE BRAZILIAN POPULATION YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT IN THE FIRST PLACE! So, this month, the government decided to raise the public transportation system taxes in São Paulo. We brazilians weren't convinced that paying more would make it stop sucking, you see. That's not how taxes work here. The buses would continue as they always have, arriving half an hour late on average, overcrowded and stinking places were my sixty-eight year old grandmother has to stand all the way. Buses are also frequent targets for robberies, so if some guy with a gun gets on board and stops the bus and you have to hand him all your stuff, that's just life. So yeah, it's only a little raise in taxes, but the people who put up with this, the people who take the bus everyday do it not because they like it, but because it's their least-worst option, and the government is abusing that. They think they can raise the taxes all they want and the people are just gonna lay down and take it. The people took to the streets on a PACIFIC MANIFESTATION and were met by the police's violence, like they're fcking criminals. WHAT KIND OF DEMOCRACY IS THIS? What happened to our freedom? Why do we have to fear those who are supposed to protect us? How dare the government set the police violently on the protestants, violating our constitutional right to manifest ourselves? What's more, the media supported them! If it weren't for the videos on the internet, people probably wouldn't know what happened, as the main TV stations severely downplayed the police's violent and abusive actions! Of course, once the population became aware of it, their lies were uncovered and the manifestations only GREW, spreading from town to town!

worldnews,c4k282m,"In 2000, PETA was contacted by a police officer who was appalled by the terrible suffering of animals in local North Carolina shelters. Some ""shelters"" were nothing more than exposed, unheated or cooled shacks that left animals to either drown or freeze, depending on the weather. PETA became involved in assisting shelters with cleaning, adoptions, training, staff, providing supplies, conducting cruelty investigations and providing adequate shelter to animals. PETA has spent over $300,000 on services to NC shelters in the last few years. Many pounds in the area had no adoption programs or even operating hours. Unwanted animals were either shot, gassed in windowless metal boxes or injected with a paralytic agent that caused them to slowly die of suffocation. These practices were carried out for decades until PETA began providing humane euthanasia. Although veterinary services for lethal injection were secured for one of the four pounds they discovered, animals at the other shelters would have been gassed, shot or died of suffocation had they not been picked up by PETA staff for euthanasia. 
 Although some of the animals have been adopted out, most of the dogs and cats from NC shelters have suffered from various debilitating conditions. These include Parvo, heart worms, mange, Lyme disease, untreated injuries, embedded collars, broken and exposed bones and severe parasitic infestations. 
 According to CCF: 
 ""PETA kills animals. Because it has other financial priorities. PETA rakes in nearly $30 million each year in income, much of it raised from pet owners who think their donations actually help animals."" 
 PETA is an international animal advocacy organization. Members are not under the false impression that they are an animal shelter. They are kept informed via email and member publications and may participate in campaigns. According to PETA's (independently audited and available upon request) statement for the fiscal year ending July 31 2008: 83.66% of funding went directly into programs. 12.16% was spent on fund raising and 4.18% on administration and operations. 29% of PETA's staff earn $19,000 to to $29,999; 45% earn $30,000 to $39,999 and 26% earn over $39,999. President Ingrid Newkirk earned 35,462 dollars in 2008. 
 Organizations like CCF not only represent multi-billion dollar corporations, but industries which are heavily subsidized by tax payers.  [{cite}](","They don't really run normal shelters, they take in animals other people won't deal with.

worldnews,cf9isb1,"I had pulled a muscle (so I thought) in my hip that made it painful to walk.  I went to an urgent care (quick diagnosis/in and out) and saw a doctor.   He asked me to walk across the small room and looked very concerned.   He called the front desk and told them to call in another doctor for the rotation, he was going to work with a patient. 
 He ordered a blood panel and said he would do the workup himself.   He was back in about five minutes with a thick file.   He told me the emergency room at the local hospital was expecting me, and I should go there immediately.   He also said ""Please hold off on eating, just in case they have to give you any medication that would upset your stomach"".  That's when I should have been worried. 
 About Me, the patient.   I was 27 years old, no real health issues at the time, and relatively healthy.   I was engaged to be married in three months time, and was not ever exposed to anything odd.   I did, however have this condition before that went away by itself without medication.   In fact, I had had swelling in my ankles, knees, and hips. I also had eyeritis (inflammation in the eye) when I was younger, but never brought it up. 
 I arrived at the hospital and was immediately ushered into an emergency room.   When I made it in there, I had two nurses and a doctor waiting for me (extremely odd).  They asked me for my emergency contact number and informed me I would be spending the night. They also wanted to do ""exploratory surgery"".  Screw me. 
I found out that what they had found was a unusually high [SED rate](   The average for a male should be 20 or lower.   Mine was between 200-300. 
 The exploratory surgery was to get a little fluid from the hip to test.   They were hopeful that they could retrieve a little.   The surgeon told me afterwards that he was lucky he had a faceshield on, because it was an eruption. 
 I believe that is when the round table started. 
 My first doctor was a cancer specialist.   He took my family history (that involved heavy amounts of cancer on my mother's side).  After a huge blood panel, he informed me that they haven't ruled out leukemia, but the list is getting shorter, so I should be prepared.   :( 
 A day later (still in the hospital), I got another doctor.   He was my cardiologist.  The good news is it isn't leukemia or cancer!  :)  The bad news,  there could be a blood clot that is traveling and got hung up, and we don't want it to get to the heart or brain.   :( 
 After the EKG, they couldn't see what they wanted to, so they were going to scope my heart.   Roughly, they would feed a tube down my throat and somehow enter my heart.  :(  Reddit,  it's magic, I dunno. 
 I didn't see him for about two days (still in hospital).  Then I had an STD test (which in hindsight, was dialing in on my disease).  I came back negative and they took more blood panels. 
 My cardiac doctor came back and told me that I was clear of any clot and thankfully would not be needing his service.   :) 
 Finally, my final specialist walked in.   Dr. Cox (honestly, I could not make that up) was an arthritis specialist.   She informed me that I had [Ankylosing Spondylitis](   She then told me about the roundtable and how it was a rare presentation of symptoms. I was in the hospital for seven days total.

 >You don't have to trust the US government, but its a predictable system just like any other system is, if you have the sufficient amount of information. 
 I readily agree with this, but it's important to consider that there is a precedent in the freedom of information act for documents to be refused for release, or to be heavily redacted and censored upon release.  This creates a situation in which there is an unknown quantity of ""bad things"" that may have happened.  This theoretical unknown is born of secrecy, and I find it alarming that such a blind spot exists when so many awful things  do  come to light. 
It is in this vacuum I fear things such as the NSA scandal would remain if not for whistle-blowers.  It's worth noting that most CIA operations remain forever secret simply because of the sensitive nature of their work, and it is in this realm, overseen only by secret courts, that illegal behavior occurs.  The American people must consistently poke and pry to get any information about what their shadowy agencies are doing on their behalf, and it's often damning and revealing.

Personally I listen to techno, music that by and large is created by people sitting in their bedrooms fiddling with a computer or some audio hardware.  Some do it for money, some do it for popularity, some do it for the sheer thrill of creating something to share with others.  Now contrast that with the corporate record companies.

I know what you're thinking, ""well then why do I see their stuff everywhere and I don't see your techno shit anywhere?""
